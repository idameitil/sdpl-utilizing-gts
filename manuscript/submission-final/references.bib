Thus, there is an urgent need to study the function and biogenesis of the OM. In Enterobacterales, an order of bacteria with many pathogenic members, one of the components of the OM is enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). We have known of the presence of ECA on the cell surface of Enterobacterales for many years, but its properties have only more recently begun to be unraveled. ECA is a carbohydrate antigen built of repeating units of three amino sugars, the structure of which is conserved throughout Enterobacterales. There are three forms of ECA, two of which (ECAPG and ECALPS) are located on the cell surface, while one (ECACYC) is located in the periplasm. Awareness of the importance of ECA has increased due to studies of its function that show it plays a vital role in bacterial physiology and interaction with the environment. Here, we review the discovery of ECA, the pathways for the biosynthesis of ECA, and the interactions of its various forms. In addition, we consider the role of ECA in the host immune response, as well as its potential roles in host-pathogen interaction. Furthermore, we explore recent work that offers insights into the cellular function of ECA. This review provides a glimpse of the biological signiﬁcance of this enigmatic molecule.},

Biosynthesis of other surface glycopolymers have also been acknowledged as potential targets for developing therapies to control bacterial infections, because of their importance for bacterial survival in the host environment. Moreover, biosynthesis of most surface glycopolymers are closely related to PG assembly because the same lipid carrier is shared for glycopolymer syntheses. In this review, I provide an overview of PG assembly and antibiotics that target this pathway. Then, I discuss the implications of a common lipid carrier being used for assembly of PG and other surface glycopolymers in antibiotic development.},

	abstract = {Background: Distance-based methods are popular for reconstructing evolutionary trees thanks to their speed and generality. A number of methods exist for estimating distances from sequence alignments, which often involves some sort of correction for multiple substitutions. The problem is to accurately estimate the number of true substitutions given an observed alignment. So far, the most accurate protein distance estimators have looked for the optimal matrix in a series of transition probability matrices, e.g. the Dayhoff series. The evolutionary distance between two aligned sequences is here estimated as the evolutionary distance of the optimal matrix. The optimal matrix can be found either by an iterative search for the Maximum Likelihood matrix, or by integration to find the Expected Distance. As a consequence, these methods are more complex to implement and computationally heavier than correction-based methods. Another problem is that the result may vary substantially depending on the evolutionary model used for the matrices. An ideal distance estimator should produce consistent and accurate distances independent of the evolutionary model used.
Results: We propose a correction-based protein sequence estimator called Scoredist. It uses a logarithmic correction of observed divergence based on the alignment score according to the BLOSUM62 score matrix. We evaluated Scoredist and a number of optimal matrix methods using three evolutionary models for both training and testing Dayhoff, Jones-Taylor-Thornton, and Müller-Vingron, as well as Whelan and Goldman solely for testing. Test alignments with known distances between 0.01 and 2 substitutions per position (1–200 PAM) were simulated using ROSE. Scoredist proved as accurate as the optimal matrix methods, yet substantially more robust. When trained on one model but tested on another one, Scoredist was nearly always more accurate. The Jukes-Cantor and Kimura correction methods were also tested, but were substantially less accurate.
Conclusion: The Scoredist distance estimator is fast to implement and run, and combines robustness with accuracy. Scoredist has been incorporated into the Belvu alignment viewer, which is available at ftp://ftp.cgb.ki.se/pub/prog/belvu/.},

O antigens are highly diverse polysaccharides that protect bacteria from their environment and engage in important host-pathogen interactions. The speciﬁc structure and composition of O antigens are the basis of classifying bacteria into O serotypes. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there are currently 20 known O-speciﬁc antigen (OSA) structures. The clusters of genes responsible for 18 of these O antigens have been identiﬁed, all of which follow the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway and are located at a common locus. In this study, we located the two unidentiﬁed O antigen biosynthesis clusters responsible for the synthesis of the O15 and the O17 OSA structures by analyzing published whole-genome sequence data. Intriguingly, these clusters were found outside the conserved OSA biosynthesis locus and were likely acquired through multiple horizontal gene transfer events. Based on data from knockout and overexpression studies, we determined that the synthesis of these O antigens follows an ABC transporter-dependent rather than a Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway. In addition, we collected evidence to show that the O15 and O17 polysaccharide chain lengths are regulated by molecular rulers with distinct and variable domain architectures. The ﬁndings in this report are critical for a comprehensive understanding of O antigen biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa and provide a framework for future studies.},

Compositional differences in the O units among the OSA from different strains form the basis of the International Antigenic Typing Scheme for classification via serotyping of different strains of P. aeruginosa.The focus of this review is to provide state-of-the-art knowledge on the genetic and resultant functional diversity of LPS produced by P. aeruginosa.The underlying factors contributing to this diversity will be thoroughly discussed and presented in the context of its contributions to host–pathogen interactions and the control/prevention of infection.},

              The structures of
              Streptococcus pneumoniae
              capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are essential for defining the antigenic as well as genetic relationships between CPS serotypes. The four serotypes that comprise CPS serogroup 35 (i.e., types 35F, 35A, 35B, and 35C) are known to cross-react with genetically related type 20, 29, 34, 42, or 47F. While the structures of CPS serotype 35A (CPS35A) and CPS35B are known, those of CPS35F and CPS35C are not. In the present study, the serotypes of CPS35F and CPS35C were characterized by high-resolution heteronuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and glycosyl composition analyses to reveal the following repeat unit structures:
              
                
              
              where OAc indicates O-acetylated. Importantly, CPS35F, the immunizing serotype for the production of group 35 serum, more closely resembles CPS34 and CPS47F than other members of serogroup 35. Moreover, CPS35C is distinct from either CPS35F or CPS35B but closely related to CPS35A and identical to de-O-acetylated CPS42. The findings provide a comprehensive view of the structural and genetic relations that exist between the members of CPS serogroup 35 and other cross-reactive serotypes.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Cross-reactions of diagnostic rabbit antisera with
              Streptococcus pneumoniae
              capsular polysaccharide serotypes are generally limited to members of the same serogroup. Exceptions do, however, occur, most notably among a group of nonvaccine serotypes that includes the members of serogroup 35 (i.e., types 35F, 35A, 35B, and 35C) and other genetically related types. The presently determined structures of
              S. pneumoniae
              serotypes 35F and 35C complete the structural characterization of serogroup 35 and thereby provide the first comprehensive description of how different members of this serogroup are related to each other and to types 29, 34, 42, and 47F. The structural and genetic features of these serotypes suggest the existence of three distinct capsular polysaccharide subgroups that presumably emerged by immune selection in the human host.},

The syntenic pair 33B/33D has nearly identical polysaccharide repeat units with the exception of one sugar residue (?2-a-Glcp in 33B and ?2-a-Galp in 33D). Serotype 33C is structurally more similar to 33B/33D than 33A/33F, in that it also possesses a backbone ribitol-phosphate group and a ?3-b-GalpNAc residue, both of which are absent in the repeat units of 33A/33F. Serotype 33C is notably different from all other serogroup 33 polysaccharides, as there is no ?3-b-Glcp residue and the location of the O-acetylation of the ?5-b-Galf residue (O-6) differs from the other serogroup 33 polysaccharides (O-2). This completes the structural assignments of polysaccharides within serogroup 33 and provides a framework for understanding the recognition of epitopes by serogroup 33 typing sera based on observed cross-reactivities reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {Background:  Many fungi boost the deconstruction of lignocellulosic plant biomass via oxidation using lytic poly‑saccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The application of LPMOs is expected to contribute to ecologically friendly conversion of biomass into fuels and chemicals. Moreover, applications of LPMO-modified cellulose-based products may be envisaged within the food or material industry.
Results:  Here, we show an up to 75-fold improvement in LPMO-driven cellulose degradation using polyphenol oxi‑dase-activated lignin building blocks. This concerted enzymatic process involves the initial conversion of monophe‑nols into diphenols by the polyphenol oxidase MtPPO7 from Myceliophthora thermophila C1 and the subsequent oxidation of cellulose by MtLPMO9B. Interestingly, MtPPO7 shows preference towards lignin-derived methoxylated monophenols. Sequence analysis of genomes of 336 Ascomycota and 208 Basidiomycota reveals a high correlation between MtPPO7 and AA9 LPMO genes.
Conclusions:  The activity towards methoxylated phenolic compounds distinguishes MtPPO7 from well-known PPOs, such as tyrosinases, and ensures that MtPPO7 is an excellent redox partner of LPMOs. The correlation between MtPPO7 and AA9 LPMO genes is indicative for the importance of the coupled action of different monooxygenases in the concerted degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. These results will contribute to a better understanding in both lignin deconstruction and enzymatic lignocellulose oxidation and potentially improve the exploration of eco-friendly routes for biomass utilization in a circular economy.},

The recombinant enzyme (TtPPO) was puriﬁed and biochemically characterized. Its production reached 40 mg/liter, and it appeared to be a glycosylated and N-terminally processed protein. TtPPO showed broad substrate speciﬁcity, as it could oxidize 28/30 compounds tested, including polyphenols, substituted phenols, catechols, and methoxyphenols. Its optimum temperature was 65°C, with a half-life of 18.3 h at 50°C, while its optimum pH was 7.5. The homology model of TtPPO was constructed, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed in order to increase its activity on mono- and dichlorophenols (di-CPs). The G292N/Y296V variant of TtPPO 5.3-fold increased activity on 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-diCP) compared to the wild type.},

            Tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (TYRP1 and TYRP2) are essential for pigmentation. They are generally classified as type-3 copper proteins, with binuclear copper active sites. Although there is experimental evidence for a copper cofactor in TYR, delivered via the copper transporter, ATP7A, the presence of copper in TYRP1 and TYRP2 has not been demonstrated. Here, we report that the expression and function of TYRP1 requires zinc, mediated by ZNT5–ZNT6 heterodimers (ZNT5–6) or ZNT7–ZNT7 homodimers (ZNT7). Loss of ZNT5–6 and ZNT7 function results in hypopigmentation in medaka fish and human melanoma cells, and is accompanied by immature melanosomes and reduced melanin content, as observed in TYRP1 dysfunction. The requirement of ZNT5–6 and ZNT7 for TYRP1 expression is conserved in human, mouse, and chicken orthologs. Our results provide novel insights into the pigmentation process and address questions regarding metalation in tyrosinase protein family.},

Phenoloxidases (catechol oxidases, COs, and laccases, LACs) are responsible for the oxidation and polymerization of phenolics. However, their origin, evolution, and differential roles during plant development and land colonization are unclear. We performed the phylogeny, domain, amino acids, compositional biases, and intron analyses to clarify the origin and evolution of COs and LACs, and analysed the structure, selective pressure, and chloroplast targeting to understand the species-dependent distribution of COs. We found that Streptophyta COs were not homologous to the Chlorophyta tyrosinases (TYRs), and might have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. COs expanded in bryophytes. Structural-functionality and selective pressure were partially responsible for the species-dependent retention of COs in embryophytes. LACs emerged in Zygnemaphyceae, having evolved from ascorbate oxidases (AAOs), and prevailed in the vascular plants and strongly expanded in seed plants. COs and LACs coevolved with the phenolic metabolism pathway genes. These results suggested that TYRs and AAOs were the first-stage phenoloxidases in Chlorophyta. COs might be the second key for the early land colonization. LACs were the third one (dominating in the vascular plants) and might be advantageous for diversified phenol substrates and the erect growth of plants. This work provided new insights into how phenoloxidases evolved and were devoted to plant evolution.},

	abstract = {Background: Hemocyanin transports O2 in the hemolymph of many arthropod species. Such respiratory proteins have long been considered unnecessary in Myriapoda. As a result, the presence of hemocyanin in Myriapoda has long been overlooked. We analyzed transcriptome and genome sequences from all major myriapod taxa – Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Symphyla, and Pauropoda – with the aim of identifying hemocyanin-like proteins.
Results: We investigated the genomes and transcriptomes of 56 myriapod species and identified 46 novel full-length hemocyanin subunit sequences in 20 species of Chilopoda, Diplopoda, and Symphyla, but not Pauropoda. We found in Cleidogona sp. (Diplopoda, Chordeumatida) a hemocyanin-like sequence with mutated copper-binding centers, which cannot bind O2. An RNA-seq approach showed markedly different hemocyanin mRNA levels from {\textasciitilde} 6 to 25,000 reads per kilobase per million reads. To evaluate the contribution of hemocyanin to O2 transport, we specifically studied the hemocyanin of the centipede Scolopendra dehaani. This species harbors two distinct hemocyanin subunits with low expression levels. We showed cooperative O2 binding in the S. dehaani hemolymph, indicating that hemocyanin supports O2 transport even at low concentration. Further, we demonstrated that hemocyanin is {\textgreater} 1500-fold more highly expressed in the fertilized egg than in the adult.
Conclusion: Hemocyanin was most likely the respiratory protein in the myriapod stem-lineage, but multiple taxa may have independently lost hemocyanin and thus the ability of efficient O2 transport. In myriapods, hemocyanin is much more widespread than initially appreciated. Some myriapods express hemocyanin only at low levels, which are, nevertheless, sufficient for O2 supply. Notably, also in myriapods, a non-respiratory protein similar to insect storage hexamerins evolved from the hemocyanin.},

            Lipopolysaccharides such as the enterobacterial common antigen are important components of the enterobacterial cell envelope that act as a protective barrier against the environment and are often polymerized by the inner membrane bound Wzy-dependent pathway. By employing cryo-electron microscopy we show that WzzE, the co-polymerase component of this pathway that is responsible for the length modulation of the enterobacterial common antigen, is octameric with alternating up-down conformations of its L4 loops. The alternating up-down nature of these essential loops, located at the top of the periplasmic bell, are modulated by clashing helical faces between adjacent protomers that flank the L4 loops around the octameric periplasmic bell. This alternating arrangement and a highly negatively charged binding face create a dynamic environment in which the polysaccharide chain is extended, and suggest a ratchet-type mechanism for polysaccharide elongation.},

            Melanin is the main pigment responsible for the color of human skin, hair and eye. Its biosynthesis requires three melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase (TYR), and the tyrosinase‐related proteins TYRP1 and TYRP2. The difficulty of isolating pure and homogeneous proteins from endogenous sources has hampered their study, and resulted in many contradictory findings regarding their physiological functions. In this review, we summarize recent advances on the structure and function of TYR and TYRPs by virtue of the crystal structure of human TYRP1, which is the first available structure of a mammalian melanogenic enzyme. This structure, combined with tyrosinase structures from other lower eukaryotes and mutagenesis studies of key active site residues, sheds light on the mechanism of TYR and TYRPs. Furthermore, a TYRP1‐based homology model of TYR provides a high‐quality platform to map and analyze albinism‐related mutations, as well as the design of specific antimelanogenic compounds. Finally, we provide perspectives for future structure/function studies of TYR and TYRPs.},

In addition, the structures reveal for the first time that the Cys-rich subdomain, which is unique to vertebrate melanogenic proteins, has an epidermal growth factor-like fold and is tightly associated with the tyrosinase subdomain.

            Lignocellulose, in the form of crop residues, presents an attractive alternative to crude oil for both the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. Its large-scale application as a feedstock, however, remains limited. A bottleneck in its implementation is the presence of lignin that envelopes the structure, physically blocking access to sugar-rich polymers that lie beneath. Here, we describe the isolation of an exceptional lignocellulose-degrading fungus that produces new oxidase activity with no cofactor requirements. This enzyme cleaves β-ether units in lignin-releasing tricin, a flavonoid of pharmaceutical potential, from the lignin macromolecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatments with this enzyme can increase the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass, offering the possibility of producing a valuable product from lignin while decreasing processing costs.

              Lignocellulose, the structural component of plant cells, is a major agricultural byproduct and the most abundant terrestrial source of biopolymers on Earth. The complex and insoluble nature of lignocellulose limits its conversion into value-added commodities, and currently, efficient transformation requires expensive pretreatments and high loadings of enzymes. Here, we report on a fungus from the
              Parascedosporium
              genus, isolated from a wheat-straw composting community, that secretes a large and diverse array of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) when grown on lignocellulosic substrates. We describe an oxidase activity that cleaves the major β-ether units in lignin, thereby releasing the flavonoid tricin from monocot lignin and enhancing the digestion of lignocellulose by polysaccharidase mixtures. We show that the enzyme, which holds potential for the biorefining industry, is widely distributed among lignocellulose-degrading fungi from the Sordariomycetes phylum.},

              Tyrosinases are an ubiquitous group of copper containing metalloenzymes that hydroxylate and oxidize phenolic molecules. In an application context the term ‘tyrosinase’ usually refers to ‘mushroom tyrosinase’ consisting of a mixture of isoenzymes and containing a number of enzymatic side-activities. We describe a protocol for the efficient heterologous production of tyrosinase 4 from
              Agaricus bisporus
              in
              Escherichia coli
              . Applying this procedure a pure preparation of a single isoform of latent tyrosinase can be achieved at a yield of 140 mg per liter of autoinducing culture medium. This recombinant protein possesses the same fold as the enzyme purified from the natural source as evidenced by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The latent enzyme can be activated by limited proteolysis with proteinase K which cleaves the polypeptide chain after K382, only one The latent enzyme can amino acid before the main
              in-vivo
              activation site. Latent tyrosinase can be used as obtained and enzymatic activity may be induced in the reaction mixture by the addition of an ionic detergent (e.g. 2 mM SDS). The proteolytically activated mushroom tyrosinase shows {\textgreater}50\% of its maximal activity in the range of pH 5 to 10 and accepts a wide range of substrates including mono- and diphenols, flavonols and chalcones.},

It is also involved in wound healing and other physiological processes. Insect PO is activated from its inactive precursor, prophenoloxidase (PPO), by specific proteolysis via a serine protease cascade. Here, we report the crystal structure of PPO from a lepidopteran insect at a resolution of 1.97 Å, which is the initial structure for a PPO from the type 3 copper protein family.
              Manduca sexta
              PPO is a heterodimer consisting of 2 homologous polypeptide chains, PPO1 and PPO2. The active site of each subunit contains a canonical type 3 di-nuclear copper center, with each copper ion coordinated with 3 structurally conserved histidines. The acidic residue Glu-395 located at the active site of PPO2 may serve as a general base for deprotonation of monophenolic substrates, which is key to the ortho-hydroxylase activity of PO. The structure provides unique insights into the mechanism by which type 3 copper proteins differ in their enzymatic activities, albeit sharing a common active center. A drastic change in electrostatic surface induced on cleavage at Arg-51 allows us to propose a model for localized PPO activation in insects.},

	abstract = {Tyrosinase catalyzes the conversion of phenolic compounds into their quinone derivatives, which are precursors for the formation of melanin, a ubiquitous pigment in living organisms. Because of its importance for browning reactions in the food industry, the tyrosinase from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus has been investigated in depth. In previous studies the tyrosinase enzyme complex was shown to be a H2L2 tetramer, but no clues were obtained of the identities of the subunits, their mode of association, and the 3D structure of the complex. Here we unravel this tetramer at the molecular level. Its 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure is the ﬁrst structure of the full fungal tyrosinase complex. The complex comprises two H subunits of ∼392 residues and two L subunits of ∼150 residues. The H subunit originates from the ppo3 gene and has a fold similar to other tyrosinases, but it is ∼100 residues larger. The L subunit appeared to be the product of orf239342 and has a lectin-like fold. The H subunit contains a binuclear copper-binding site in the deoxy-state, in which three histidine residues coordinate each copper ion. The side chains of these histidines have their orientation ﬁxed by hydrogen bonds or, in the case of His85, by a thioether bridge with the side chain of Cys83. The speciﬁc tyrosinase inhibitor tropolone forms a pre-Michaelis complex with the enzyme. It binds near the binuclear copper site without directly coordinating the copper ions. The function of the ORF239342 subunits is not known. Carbohydrate binding sites identiﬁed in other lectins are not conserved in ORF239342, and the subunits are over 25 Å away from the active site, making a role in activity unlikely. The structures explain how calcium ions stabilize the tetrameric state of the enzyme.},

Tyrosinases perform two sequential enzymatic reactions: hydroxylation of monophenols and oxidation of diphenols to form quinones which polymerize spontaneously to melanin. Two other members of this family are catechol oxidases, which are prevalent mainly in plants and perform only the second oxidation step, and hemocyanins, which lack enzymatic activity and are oxygen carriers. In the last decade, several structures of plant and bacterial tyrosinases were determined, some with substrates or inhibitors, highlighting features and residues which are important for copper uptake and catalysis.

The key residues inﬂuencing tyrosinase speciﬁcity are not well known. Random mutagenesis was performed on tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium in order to ﬁnd variants with altered selectivity. A high throughput colorimetric screening assay in 96-well plates was used to evaluate separately the monophenolase and diphenolase activity. Variant R209H exhibited a 1.7-fold increase in monophenolase activity accompanied by a 1.5-fold decrease in diphenolase activity, resulting in a 2.6fold improvement in the monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio.

              Type‐III copper enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitous among organisms and play a significant role in the formation of pigments. PPOs comprise different enzyme groups, including tyrosinases (TYRs) and catechol oxidases (COs). TYRs catalyze the

              o
              ‐quinones (EC 1.10.3.1). To date (August 2020), 102 PDB entries encompassing 18 different proteins from 16 organisms and several mutants have been reported, identifying key residues for tyrosinase activity. The structural similarity between TYRs and COs, especially within and around the active center, complicates the elucidation of their modes of action on a structural basis. However, mutagenesis studies illuminate residues that influence the two activities and show that crystallography on its own cannot elucidate the enzymatic activity mode. Several amino acid residues around the dicopper active center have been proposed to play an essential role in the two different activities. Herein, we critically review the role of all residues identified so far that putatively affect the two activities of PPOs.},

Therefore, a library of 39 mutants of AUS from Coreopsis grandiflora (CgAUS) was generated and the activity studies showed that the reactivity of the three conserved histidines (HisA2, HisB1, and HisB2) is tuned by their adjacent residues (HisB1 + 1, HisB2 + 1, and waterkeeper residue) either to react as stronger bases or / and to stabilize a position permissive for substrate proton shuffling.

              Malus domestica
              (apple,
              Md
              PPO). The three pro-enzymes
              Md
              PPO1-3 were heterologously expressed in
              E. coli
              yielding substantial amounts of protein and have been characterized with regard to their optimum of activity resulting from SDS, acidic and proteolytic activation. Significant differences were found in the kinetic characterization of
              Md
              PPO1-3 when applying different mono- and diphenolic substrates. All three enzymes have been classified as tyrosinases, where
              Md
              PPO1 exhibits the highest activity with tyramine (k

              PPO2 and
              Md
              PPO3 are also clearly active on this monophenolic substrate (k

              , respectively). Based on the activity, sequence data and homology modelling it is proposed that the monophenolase and diphenolase activity of PPOs can be manipulated by the appropriate combination of two amino acids, which are located within the active site cleft and were therefore named “activity controllers”.},

There is great variability in the subunit molecular mass reported for PPO, even from a single species. In some cases, experimental evidence (usually protein sequencing by Edman degradation) indicates that the variability in molecular mass for PPO from a given species is the result of proteolytic processing at the N and/or C-termini of the protein. In order to identify speciﬁc sequence regions where proteolysis occurs in PPO from most species, the experimentally established N and C-termini of these proteolyzed enzymes were compared to the protein sequences of other PPOs for which the N and C-termini have not been established by protein sequencing methods. In all cases the N-terminal proteolysis sites were located prior to a conserved arginine residue, and the C-terminal proteolysis sites were located following a conserved tyrosine motif. Based on the sites of proteolysis, molecular masses were calculated for the enzymes, and the calculated values were used to rationalize the varying molecular masses reported in the literature. To determine the structural implications of N and C-terminal proteolysis, the proteolysis sites were related to the two available PPO structures: Ipomoea batatas catechol oxidase and Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase. A structural ‘‘core” region that appears to be essential for structural stability and enzymatic activity was identiﬁed.},

We recently determined the structure of the Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase revealing a residue, V218, which we proposed to take part in positioning of substrates within the active site. In the structure of catechol oxidase from Ipomoea batatas, the lack of monophenolase activity was attributed to the presence of F261 near CuA. Consequently, we engineered two variants, V218F and V218G. V218F was expected to have a decreased monophenolase activity, due to the bulky residue extending into the active site. Surprisingly, both V218F and V218G exhibited a 9- and 4.4-fold higher monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio, respectively. X-ray structures of variant V218F display a ﬂexibility of the phenylalanine residue along with an adjacent histidine, which we propose to be the source of the change in activity ratio.},

              PPO2 accepts only diphenolic substrates like dopamine (k

              PPO1 (PDB: 6HQI and 6HQJ) reveals an unprecedented high flexibility of the gatekeeper residue phenylalanine (Phe270). Docking studies showed that depending on its orientation the gatekeeper residue could either stabilize and correctly position incoming substrates or hinder their entrance into the active site. Furthermore, phloretin, a substrate of

              PPO1 (K

              Sl

	abstract = {Background: Tyrosinases, tyrosinase-related proteins, catechol oxidases and hemocyanins comprise the type-3 copper protein family and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including pigment formation, innate immunity and oxygen transport. Although this family is present in the three domains of life, its origin and early evolution are not well understood. Previous analyses of type-3 copper proteins largely have focussed on specific animal and plant phyla.
Results: Here, we combine genomic, phylogenetic and structural analyses to show that the original type-3 copper protein possessed a signal peptide and may have been secreted (we designate proteins of this type the α subclass). This ancestral type-3 copper protein gene underwent two duplication events, the first prior to the divergence of the unikont eukaryotic lineages and the second before the diversification of animals. The former duplication gave rise to a cytosolic form (β) and the latter to a membrane-bound form (γ). Structural comparisons reveal that the active site of α and γ forms are covered by aliphatic amino acids, and the β form has a highly conserved aromatic residue in this position. The subsequent evolution of this gene family in modern lineages of multicellular eukaryotes is typified by the loss of one or more of these three subclasses and the lineage-specific expansion of one or both of the remaining subclasses.
Conclusions: The diversity of type-3 copper proteins in animals and other eukaryotes is consistent with two ancient gene duplication events leading to α, β and γ subclasses, followed by the differential loss and expansion of one or more of these subclasses in specific kingdoms and phyla. This has led to many lineage-specific type-3 copper protein repertoires and in some cases the independent evolution of functionally-classified tyrosinases and hemocyanins. For example, the oxygen-carrying hemocyanins in arthropods evolved from a β-subclass tyrosinase, whilst hemocyanins in molluscs and urochordates evolved independently from an α-subclass tyrosinase. Minor conformational changes at the active site of α, β and γ forms can produce type-3 copper proteins with capacities to either carry oxygen (hemocyanins), oxidize diphenols (catechol oxidase) or o-hydroxylate monophenols (tyrosinases) and appear to underlie some functional convergences.},

              Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitously distributed among plants, bacteria, fungi and animals. They catalyze the hydroxylation of monophenols (monophenolase activity) and the oxidation of
              o
              -diphenols (diphenolase activity) to
              o
              -quinones. PPOs are commonly present as an isoenzyme family. In walnut (
              Juglans regia
              ), two different genes (
              jr
              PPO1 and
              jr
              PPO2) encoding PPOs have been identified. In this study,
              jr
              PPO2 was, for the first time, heterologously expressed in
              E. coli
              and characterized as a tyrosinase (TYR) by substrate scope assays and kinetic investigations, as it accepted tyramine and L-tyrosine as substrates. Moreover, the substrate acceptance and kinetic parameters (
              k
              cat
              and
              K
              m
              values) towards 16 substrates naturally present in walnut were assessed for
              jr
              PPO2 (TYR) and its isoenzyme
              jr
              PPO1 (TYR). The two isoenzymes prefer different substrates, as
              jr
              PPO1 shows a higher activity towards monophenols, whereas
              jr
              PPO2 is more active towards
              o
              -diphenols. Molecular docking studies performed herein revealed that the amino acid residue in the position of the 1st activity controller (His
              B1

              jr
              PPO1 Asn240 and
              jr
              PPO2 Gly240) is responsible for the different enzymatic activities. Additionally, interchanging the 1st activity controller residue of the two enzymes in two mutants (
              jr
              PPO1-Asn240Gly and
              jr
              PPO2-Gly240Asn) proved that the amino acid residue located in this position allows plants to selectively target or dismiss substrates naturally present in walnut.},

Their involvement lies in their ability to oxidize phenolic or polyphenolic compounds, which subsequently form pigments. The PPO family includes tyrosinases and catechol oxidases, which, in spite of their high structural similarity, exhibit different catalytic activities. Long-standing research efforts have not yet managed to decipher the structural determinants responsible for this differentiation, as every new theory is disproved by a more recent study. In the present work, we combined biochemical along with structural data in order to better understand the function of a previously characterized PPO from Thermothelomyces thermophila (TtPPO). The crystal structure of a TtPPO variant, determined at 1.55 Å resolution, represents the second known structure of an ascomycete PPO. Kinetic data for structure-guided mutants prove the implication of “gate” residue L306, residue HB111 (G292), and HB211 (Y296) in TtPPO function against various substrates. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the role of L306 in the accommodation of bulky substrates and show that residue HB111 is unlikely to determine monophenolase activity, as was suggested from previous studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Plant polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are enzymes that typically use molecular oxygen to oxidize ortho-diphenols to ortho-quinones. These commonly cause browning reactions following tissue damage, and may be important in plant defense. Some PPOs function as hydroxylases or in cross-linking reactions, but in most plants their physiological roles are not known. To better understand the importance of PPOs in the plant kingdom, we surveyed PPO gene families in 25 sequenced genomes from chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, and flowering plants. The PPO genes were then analyzed in silico for gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, and targeting signals.
Results: Many previously uncharacterized PPO genes were uncovered. The moss, Physcomitrella patens, contained 13 PPO genes and Selaginella moellendorffii (spike moss) and Glycine max (soybean) each had 11 genes. Populus trichocarpa (poplar) contained a highly diversified gene family with 11 PPO genes, but several flowering plants had only a single PPO gene. By contrast, no PPO-like sequences were identified in several chlorophyte (green algae) genomes or Arabidopsis (A. lyrata and A. thaliana). We found that many PPOs contained one or two introns often near the 3’ terminus. Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis using ChloroP and TargetP 1.1 predicted that several putative PPOs are synthesized via the secretory pathway, a unique finding as most PPOs are predicted to be chloroplast proteins. Phylogenetic reconstruction of these sequences revealed that large PPO gene repertoires in some species are mostly a consequence of independent bursts of gene duplication, while the lineage leading to Arabidopsis must have lost all PPO genes.
Conclusion: Our survey identified PPOs in gene families of varying sizes in all land plants except in the genus Arabidopsis. While we found variation in intron numbers and positions, overall PPO gene structure is congruent with the phylogenetic relationships based on primary sequence data. The dynamic nature of this gene family differentiates PPO from other oxidative enzymes, and is consistent with a protein important for a diversity of functions relating to environmental adaptation.},

The analyzed proteins could be divided in two groups with different lengths (350–400 and 400–600 residues), suggesting the presence of a new class of secreted enzymes lacking the C-terminal domain. Among them, a sequence from Aspergillus oryzae (408 aa, AoCO4) was selected for production and characterization. AoCO4 was expressed in Trichoderma reesei under the strong cbh1 promoter. Expression of AoCO4 in T. reesei resulted in high yields of extracellular enzyme, corresponding to 1.5 g L−1 production of the enzyme. AoCO4 was purified with a twostep purification procedure, consisting of cation and anion exchange chromatography. The N-terminal analysis of the protein revealed N-terminal processing taking place in the Kex2/furin-type protease cleavage site and removing the first 51 amino acids from the putative N-terminus. AoCO4 activity was tested on various substrates, and the highest activity was found on 4-tert-butylcatechol. Because no activity was detected on L-tyrosine and on L-dopa, AoCO4 was classified as a catechol oxidase. AoCO4 showed the highest activity within an acidic and neutral pH range, having an optimum at pH 5.6. AoCO4 showed good pH stability within a neutral and alkaline pH range and good thermostability up to 60°C. The UV–visible and circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis suggested that the folding of the protein was correct.},

It is presumed that the same is true of polyphenol oxidase from plants and fungi although the structure of a polyphenol oxidase containing the C-terminal domain has not been determined.

            Catechol oxidases and tyrosinases belong to the family of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). In contrast to tyrosinases, catechol oxidases were so far defined to lack hydroxylase activity toward monophenols. Aurone synthase (AUS1) is a plant catechol oxidase that specializes in the conversion of chalcones to aurones (flower pigments). We evidence for the first time, to our knowledge, hydroxylase activity for a catechol oxidase (AUS1) toward its natural monophenolic substrate (chalcone). The presented first crystal structure of a plant pro-PPO provides insights into its activation mechanisms, and based on biochemical and structural studies of AUS1, we propose a novel catalytic reaction mechanism for plant PPOs. The proven hydroxylase functionality of AUS1 suggests that other catechol oxidases might also be involved in the plant’s secondary metabolism.

              Tyrosinases and catechol oxidases belong to the family of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). Tyrosinases catalyze the
              o
              -hydroxylation and oxidation of phenolic compounds, whereas catechol oxidases were so far defined to lack the hydroxylation activity and catalyze solely the oxidation of
              o
              -diphenolic compounds. Aurone synthase from
              Coreopsis grandiflora
              (AUS1) is a specialized plant PPO involved in the anabolic pathway of aurones. We present, to our knowledge, the first crystal structures of a latent plant PPO, its mature active and inactive form, caused by a sulfation of a copper binding histidine. Analysis of the latent proenzyme’s interface between the shielding C-terminal domain and the main core provides insights into its activation mechanisms. As AUS1 did not accept common tyrosinase substrates (tyrosine and tyramine), the enzyme is classified as a catechol oxidase. However, AUS1 showed hydroxylase activity toward its natural substrate (isoliquiritigenin), revealing that the hydroxylase activity is not correlated with the acceptance of common tyrosinase substrates. Therefore, we propose that the hydroxylase reaction is a general functionality of PPOs. Molecular dynamics simulations of docked substrate–enzyme complexes were performed, and a key residue was identified that influences the plant PPO’s acceptance or rejection of tyramine. Based on the evidenced hydroxylase activity and the interactions of specific residues with the substrates during the molecular dynamics simulations, a novel catalytic reaction mechanism for plant PPOs is proposed. The presented results strongly suggest that the physiological role of plant catechol oxidases were previously underestimated, as they might hydroxylate their—so far unknown—natural substrates in vivo.},

              Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall that is synthetized during cell division and elongation. PG forms an extracellular polymer crucial for cellular viability, the synthesis of which is the target of many antibiotics. PG assembly requires a glycosyltransferase (GT) to generate a glycan polymer using a Lipid II substrate, which is then crosslinked to the existing PG via a transpeptidase (TP) reaction. A Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) GT enzyme and a Class B Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) form the core of the multi-protein complex required for PG assembly. Here we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cell elongation-specific
              E. coli
              RodA-PBP2 complex. We combine this information with biochemical, genetic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses to identify the Lipid II binding sites and propose a mechanism for Lipid II polymerization. Our data suggest a hypothesis for the movement of the glycan strand from the Lipid II polymerization site of RodA towards the TP site of PBP2, functionally linking these two central enzymatic activities required for cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli includes clonal groups of both commensal and pathogenic strains, with some of the latter causing serious infectious diseases. O antigen variation is current standard in defining strains for taxonomy and epidemiology, providing the basis for many serotyping schemes for Gram-negative bacteria. This review covers the diversity in E. coli O antigen structures and gene clusters, and the genetic basis for the structural diversity. Of the 187 formally defined O antigens, six (O31, O47, O67, O72, O94 and O122) have since been removed and three (O34, O89 and O144) strains do not produce any O antigen. Therefore, structures are presented for 176 of the 181 E. coli O antigens, some of which include subgroups. Most (93\%) of these O antigens are synthesized via the Wzx/Wzy pathway, 11 via the ABC transporter pathway, with O20, O57 and O60 still uncharacterized due to failure to find their O antigen gene clusters. Biosynthetic pathways are given for 38 of the 49 sugars found in E. coli O antigens, and several pairs or groups of the E. coli antigens that have related structures show close relationships of the O antigen gene clusters within clades, thereby highlighting the genetic basis of the evolution of diversity.},

These polymers afford the producing bacteria protection from a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological stresses, support biofilms, and play critical roles in interactions between bacteria and their immediate environments. Their biological and physical properties also drive a variety of industrial and biomedical applications. Despite the immense variation in capsular polysaccharide and exopolysaccharide structures, patterns are evident in strategies used for their assembly and export.

              Synthesis of capsular polysaccharide (CPS), an important virulence factor of pathogenic bacteria, is modulated by the CpsBCD phosphoregulatory system in Streptococcus. Serine/threonine kinases (STKs, e.g. Stk1) can also regulate CPS synthesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify a protein (CcpS) that is phosphorylated by Stk1 and modulates the activity of phosphatase CpsB in
              Streptococcus suis
              , thus linking Stk1 to CPS synthesis. The crystal structure of CcpS shows an intrinsically disordered region at its N-terminus, including two threonine residues that are phosphorylated by Stk1. The activity of phosphatase CpsB is inhibited when bound to non-phosphorylated CcpS. Thus, CcpS modulates the activity of phosphatase CpsB thereby altering CpsD phosphorylation, which in turn modulates the expression of the Wzx-Wzy pathway and thus CPS production.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm is reported which builds an alignment between two protein structures. The algorithm involves a combinatorial extension (CE) of an alignment path defined by aligned fragment pairs (AFPs) rather than the more conventional techniques using dynamic programming and Monte Carlo optimization. AFPs, as the name suggests, are pairs of fragments, one from each protein, which confer structure similarity. AFPs are based on local geometry, rather than global features such as orientation of secondary structures and overall topology. Combinations of AFPs that represent possible continuous alignment paths are selectively extended or discarded thereby leading to a single optimal alignment. The algorithm is fast and accurate in finding an optimal structure alignment and hence suitable for database scanning and detailed analysis of large protein families. The method has been tested and compared with results from Dali and VAST using a representative sample of similar structures. Several new structural similarities not detected by these other methods are reported. Specific one-on-one alignments and searches against all structures as found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) can be performed via the Web at http://cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html.},

            2
            . Central to the divisome is the peptidoglycan-synthesising protein complex FtsWI, with the transglycosylase (TG) FtsW polymerising glycan strands from its substrate Lipid II
            3,4

The structure reveals the intricate details of the periplasmic interfaces within FtsWIQBL, including the positioning of FtsI by the coiled coil of FtsBL, as well as a transmembrane domain containing FtsWIBL but not FtsQ. With our structure we are able to provide molecular mechanisms of a multitude of known mutations that interfere with divisome activation and regulation. Finally, we reveal a large conformational switch between presumably inactive and active states of the FtsWI core enzymes.
          
          
            Our work is foundational for further structural, biochemical and genetic studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bacterial cell division.

	abstract = {Over 2500 Salmonella species (alternatively, serovars) encompassing different combinations of O-, H1- and H2-antigens are present in nature and cause millions of deaths worldwide every year. Since conventional serotyping is time-consuming, a user-friendly Salmonella species serotyping (SSP) web tool(https://project.iith.ac.in/SSP/) is developed here to predict the serotypes using Salmonella protein(s) or whole proteome sequences. Prior to SSP implementation, a detailed analysis of protein sequences involved in O-antigen biosynthesis and H-antigen formation is carried out to assess their serotype specificity. Intriguingly, the results indicate that WbaP, WecA and GNE initializing transferases can efficiently distinguish the O-antigens, which have Gal, GlcNAc and GalNAc as initial sugars respectively. Rigorous analysis shows that Wzx and Wzy are sufficient to distinguish the O-types. Exceptionally, some situations warrant additional proteins. Thus, 150 additional transferases, RfbE for O2, O9 and O9,46types, Orf17.4 for O3,10 and O1,3,19types, WecB,WbbE and WbbF for O54 and, Wzm and Wzt for O67 are utilized in serotyping. An in-depth analysis of 302 reference datasets representing 56 H1- and 20 H2-types leads to the identification and utilization of 61 unique sequence patterns of FliC and FljB in H-typing. A test dataset of 2136 whole proteome sequences covering 740 Salmonella serovars, including 13 new species and all the O-, H1and H2-antigens are successfully predicted with 99.72\% accuracy. Indeed, SSP also identifies wrongly annotated Salmonella species, hence, can easily identify new species that emerge with any combination of O-, H1- and H2-antigens. Thus, SSP can act as a valuable tool in the surveillance of Salmonella species.},

	abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important human pathogen. Its virulence is largely due to its polysaccharide capsule, which shields it from the host immune system, and because of this, the capsule has been extensively studied. Studies of the capsule led to the identiﬁcation of DNA as the genetic material, identiﬁcation of many different capsular serotypes, and identiﬁcation of the serotype-speciﬁc nature of protection by adaptive immunity. Recent studies have led to the determination of capsular polysaccharide structures for many serotypes using advanced analytical technologies, complete elucidation of genetic basis for the capsular types, and the development of highly effective pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Conjugate vaccine use has altered the serotype distribution by either serotype replacement or switching, and this has increased the need to serotype pneumococci. Due to great advances in molecular technologies and our understanding of the pneumococcal genome, molecular approaches have become powerful tools to predict pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, more-precise and -efﬁcient serotyping methods that directly detect polysaccharide structures are emerging. These improvements in our capabilities will greatly enhance future investigations of pneumococcal epidemiology and diseases and the biology of colonization and innate immunity to pneumococcal capsules.},

Using Escherichia coli as a model system, we identified a PBP2 variant that promotes Rod system function when essential accessory components of the machinery are inactivated. This PBP2 variant hyperactivates cell wall synthesis in vivo and stimulates the activity of RodA-PBP2 complexes in vitro. Cells with the activated synthase also exhibited enhanced polymerization of the actin-like MreB component of the Rod system. Our results define an activation pathway governing Rod system function in which PBP2 conformation plays a central role in stimulating both glycan polymerization by its partner RodA and the formation of cytoskeletal filaments of MreB to orient cell wall assembly. In light of these results, previously isolated mutations that activate cytokinesis suggest that an analogous pathway may also control cell wall synthesis by the division machinery.},

The inner membrane polymerase WzySF catalyzes the repeat addition of undecaprenol-diphosphate-linked Oag (Und-PP-RUs) to produce a polysaccharide, the length of which is tightly regulated by two competing copolymerase proteins, WzzSF (short-type Oag; 10 to 17 RUs) and WzzpHS-2 (very-long-type Oag; .90 RUs). The nature of the interaction between WzySF and WzzSF/ WzzpHS-2 in Oag polymerization remains poorly characterized, with the majority of the literature characterizing the individual protein constituents of the Wzy-dependent pathway. Here, we report instead a major investigation into the speciﬁc binding interactions of WzySF with its copolymerase counterparts. For the ﬁrst time, a region of WzySF that forms a unique binding site for WzzpHS-2 has been identiﬁed. Speciﬁcally, this work has elucidated key WzySF moieties at the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) that form an intramolecular pocket modulating the WzzpHS-2 interaction. Novel copuriﬁcation data highlight that disruption of residues within this NTD-CTD pocket impairs the interaction with WzzpHS-2 without affecting WzzSF binding, thereby speciﬁcally disrupting polymerization of longer polysaccharide chains. This study provides a novel understanding of the molecular interaction of WzySF with WzzSF/WzzpHS-2 in the Wzy-dependent pathway and, furthermore, detects the Wzy/Wzz/Und-PP-Oag complex for the ﬁrst time. Beyond S. ﬂexneri, this work may be extended to provide insight into the interactions between protein homologues expressed by related species, especially members of Enterobacteriaceae, that produce dual Oag chain length determinants.},

	abstract = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ ≥ 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.},

	abstract = {Shigella is one of the commonest causes of diarrhoea worldwide and a major public health problem. Shigella serotyping is based on a standardized scheme that splits Shigella strains into four serogroups and 60 serotypes on the basis of biochemical tests and O-­antigen structures. This conventional serotyping method is laborious, time-c­ onsuming, impossible to automate, and requires a high level of expertise. Whole-g­ enome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more affordable and is now used for routine surveillance, opening up possibilities for the development of much-­needed accurate rapid typing methods. Here, we describe ShigaPass, a new in silico tool for predicting Shigella serotypes from WGS assemblies on the basis of rfb gene cluster DNA sequences, phage and plasmid-e­ ncoded O-­antigen modification genes, seven housekeeping genes (EnteroBase’s MLST scheme), fliC alleles and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) spacers. Using 4879 genomes, including 4716 reference strains and clinical isolates of Shigella characterized with a panel of biochemical tests and serotyped by slide agglutination, we show here that ShigaPass outperforms all existing in silico tools, particularly for the identification of Shigella boydii and Shigella dysenteriae serotypes, with a correct serotype assignment rate of 98.5 \% and a sensitivity rate (i.e. ability to make any prediction) of 100 \%.},

	abstract = {Enterobacteriales have evolved a specialized outer membrane polysaccharide [Enterobacterial Common Antigen (ECA)] which allows them to persist in various environmental niches. Biosynthesis of ECA initiates on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane (IM) where glycosyltransferases assemble ECA repeat units (RUs). Complete RUs are then translocated across the IM and assembled into polymers by ECA-­specific homologues of the Wzy-­dependent pathway. Consisting of the membrane proteins Wzx, Wzy and Wzz, the Wzy-­dependent pathway is the most common polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway in Gram-­negative bacteria where it is most notably involved in LPS O antigen (Oag) biosynthesis. As such, the majority of research directed towards these proteins has been orientated towards Oag biosynthetic homologues with little directed towards ECA homologues. Belonging to the Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) protein family, Wzy proteins are polymerases, and are characterized as possessing little or no peptide homology among homologues as well as being polytopic membrane proteins with functionally relevant residues within periplasmic loops, as defined by C-­terminal reporter fusion topology mapping. Here, we present the first the first major study into the ECA polymerase WzyE. Multiple sequence alignments and topology mapping showed that WzyE is unlike WzyB proteins involved with Oag biosynthesis WzyE displays high peptide conservation across Enterobacteriales. In silico structures and reporter mapping allowed us to identify possible functionally conserved residues with WzyESF’s periplasmic loops, which we showed were crucial for its function. This work provides novel insight into Wzy proteins and suggests that WzyE is an optimal model to investigate Wzy proteins and the Wzy-­dependent pathway.},

Only two structural folds, GT-A and GT-B, have been identiﬁed for the nucleotide sugar-dependent enzymes, but other folds are now appearing for the soluble domains of lipid phosphosugar-dependent glycosyl transferases. Structural and kinetic studies have provided new insights. Inverting glycosyltransferases utilize a direct displacement SN2-like mechanism involving an enzymatic base catalyst. Leaving group departure in GT-A fold enzymes is typically facilitated via a coordinated divalent cation, whereas GT-B fold enzymes instead use positively charged side chains and/or hydroxyls and helix dipoles. The mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases is less clear. The expected two-step doubledisplacement mechanism is rendered less likely by the lack of conserved architecture in the region where a catalytic nucleophile would be expected. A mechanism involving a short-lived oxocarbenium ion intermediate now seems the most likely, with the leaving phosphate serving as the base.},

            The O157:H7 strain of Escherichia coli is responsible for frequent outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis worldwide. Its lipopolysaccharide is a virulence factor and contains an O antigen having repeating units with the tetrasaccharide structure [2-D-PerNAcα1-3-L-Fucα1-4-D-Glcβ1-3-D-GalNAcα1-]n. Genes encoding glycosyltransferases WbdN, WbdO, and WbdP are responsible for the biosynthesis of this repeating unit. We have previously characterized the second enzyme in the pathway, WbdN, which transfers Glc in β1-3 linkage to GalNAcα-O-PO3-PO3-(CH2)11-O-Ph (GalNAc-PP-PhU). In this work, Fuc-transferase WbdO from E. coli O157:H7 expressed in BL21 bacteria was characterized using the product of WbdN as the acceptor substrate. We showed that WbdO is specific for GDP-β-L-Fuc as the donor substrate. Compounds that contained terminal Glc or Glcβ1-3GalNAc structures but lacked the diphosphate group did not serve as acceptor substrates. The structure of the WbdO product was identified by mass spectrometry and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as L-Fucα1-4-D-Glcβ1-3-D-GalNAc PP-PhU. WbdO is an unusual bivalent metal ion-dependent Fuc-transferase classified as an inverting GT2 family enzyme that has 2 conserved sequences near the N-terminus. The Asp37 residue within the 36VDGGSTD42 sequence was found to be essential for catalysis. Mutation of Asp68 to Ala within the conserved 67YDAMNK72 sequence resulted in a 3-fold increase in activity. These studies show that WbdOO157 is a highly specific Fuc-transferase with little homology to other characterized Fuc-transferases.},

The other 12 O antigens unique to Shigella strains have structures that are typical of E. coli, but there are considerably more anomalies in their gene clusters, probably reﬂecting recent modiﬁcation of the structures.

Most species produce one of the structurally diverse O-antigens, with nearly all the polysaccharide components having complex structures made by the Wzx/Wzy pathway. This pathway produces repeat-units of mostly 3-8 sugars on the cytosolic face of the cytoplasmic membrane that is translocated by Wzx flippase to the periplasmic face and polymerized by Wzy polymerase to give long-chain polysaccharides. The Wzy polymerase is a highly diverse integral membrane protein typically containing 10-14 transmembrane segments. Biochemical evidence confirmed that Wzy polymerase is the sole driver of polymerization, and recent progress also began to demystify its interacting partner, Wzz, shedding some light to speculate how the proteins may operate together during polysaccharide biogenesis. However, our knowledge of how the highly variable Wzy proteins work as part of the O-antigen processing machinery remains poor. Here, we discuss the progress to the current understanding of repeat-unit polymerization and propose an updated model to explain the formation of additional short chain O-antigen polymers found in the lipopolysaccharide of diverse Gram-negative species and their importance in the biosynthetic process.},

The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Recent biochemical and molecular genetic studies in yeast have yielded novel insights into this enzyme with multiple tasks. Nine proteins have been shown to be OST components. These are assembled into a heterooligomeric membrane-bound complex and are required for optimal expression of OST activity in vivo in wild type cells. In accord with the evolutionary conservation of core N-glycosylation, there are significant homologies between the protein sequences of OST subunits from yeast and higher eukaryotes, and OST complexes from different sources show a similar organisation as well. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

              Unlike proteins, glycan chains are not directly encoded by DNA, but by the specificity of the enzymes that assemble them. Theoretical calculations have proposed an astronomical number of possible isomers ({\textgreater} 10
              12
              hexasaccharides) but the actual diversity of glycan structures in nature is not known. Bacteria of the Bacteroidetes phylum are considered primary degraders of polysaccharides and they are found in all ecosystems investigated. In Bacteroidetes genomes, carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZymes) are arranged in gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). The depolymerization of a given complex glycan by Bacteroidetes PULs requires bespoke enzymes; conversely, the enzyme composition in PULs can provide information on the structure of the targeted glycans. Here we group the 13,537 PULs encoded by 964 Bacteroidetes genomes according to their CAZyme composition. We find that collectively Bacteroidetes have elaborated a few thousand enzyme combinations for glycan breakdown, suggesting a global estimate of diversity of glycan structures much smaller than the theoretical one.},

	abstract = {The number of all possible linear and branched isomers of a hexasaccharide was calculated and found to be {\textgreater} 1.05 x 10(12). This large number defines the Isomer Barrier, a persistent technological barrier to the development of a single analytical method for the absolute characterization of carbohydrates, regardless of sample quantity. Because of this isomer barrier, no single method can be employed to determine complete oligosaccharide structure in 100 nmol amounts with the same assurance that can be achieved for 100 pmol amounts with single-procedure Edman peptide or Sanger DNA sequencing methods. Difficulties in the development of facile synthetic schemes for oligosaccharides are also explained by this large number. No current method of chemical or physical analysis has the resolution necessary to distinguish among 10(12) structures having the same mass. Therefore the 'characterization' of a middle-weight oligosaccharide solely by NMR or mass spectrometry necessarily contains a very large margin of error. Greater uncertainty accompanies results performed solely by sequential enzyme degradation followed by gel-permeation chromatography or electrophoresis, as touted by some commercial advertisements. Much of the literature which uses these single methods to 'characterize' complex carbohydrates is, therefore, in question, and journals should beware of publishing structural characterizations unless the authors reveal all alternate possible structures which could result from their analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

                -peptidases and penicillin-hydrolyzing serine β-lactamases diverged from a common ancestor by the acquisition of structural changes in the polypeptide chain while retaining the same folding, three-motif amino acid sequence signature, serine-assisted catalytic mechanism, and active-site topology. Fusion events gave rise to multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The acyl serine transferase penicillin-binding (PB) module possesses the three active-site defining motifs of the superfamily; it is linked to the carboxy end of a non-penicillin-binding (n-PB) module through a conserved fusion site; the two modules form a single polypeptide chain which folds on the exterior of the plasma membrane and is anchored by a transmembrane spanner; and the full-size PBPs cluster into two classes, A and B. In the class A PBPs, the n-PB modules are a continuum of diverging sequences; they possess a five-motif amino acid sequence signature, and conserved dicarboxylic amino acid residues are probably elements of the glycosyl transferase catalytic center. The PB modules fall into five subclasses: A1 and A2 in gram-negative bacteria and A3, A4, and A5 in gram-positive bacteria. The full-size class A PBPs combine the required enzymatic activities for peptidoglycan assembly from lipid-transported disaccharide-peptide units and almost certainly prescribe different, PB-module specific traits in peptidoglycan cross-linking. In the class B PBPs, the PB and n-PB modules cluster in a concerted manner. A PB module of subclass B2 or B3 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B2 or B3 in gram-negative bacteria, and a PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 in gram-positive bacteria. Class B PBPs are involved in cell morphogenesis. The three motifs borne by the n-PB modules are probably sites for module-module interaction and the polypeptide stretches which extend between motifs 1 and 2 are sites for protein-protein interaction. The full-size class B PBPs are an assortment of orthologs and paralogs, which prescribe traits as complex as wall expansion and septum formation. PBPs of subclass B1 are unique to gram-positive bacteria. They are not essential, but they represent an important mechanism of resistance to penicillin among the enterococci and staphylococci. Natural evolution and PBP- and β-lactamase-mediated resistance show that the ability of the catalytic centers to adapt their properties to new situations is limitless. Studies of the reaction pathways by using the methods of quantum chemistry suggest that resistance to penicillin is a road of no return.},

            How we choose to represent our data has a fundamental impact on our ability to subsequently extract information from them. Machine learning promises to automatically determine efficient representations from large unstructured datasets, such as those arising in biology. However, empirical evidence suggests that seemingly minor changes to these machine learning models yield drastically different data representations that result in different biological interpretations of data. This begs the question of what even constitutes the most meaningful representation. Here, we approach this question for representations of protein sequences, which have received considerable attention in the recent literature. We explore two key contexts in which representations naturally arise: transfer learning and interpretable learning. In the first context, we demonstrate that several contemporary practices yield suboptimal performance, and in the latter we demonstrate that taking representation geometry into account significantly improves interpretability and lets the models reveal biological information that is otherwise obscured.},

The distribution of chain lengths in the absence of this gene fits a model in which as the chain is extended there is a constant probability of 0.165 of transfer of growing chain to LPS core, with termination of chain extension. The data for E. coli O111 fit a model in which the CLD reduces this probability for short chains and increases it to 0.4 for longer chains, leading to a reduced number of short chain molecules but an increase in numbers of longer molecules and transfer of essentially all molecules by chain length 21. We put forward a model for O-antigen polymerase which resembles the ribosome and fatty acid synthetase in having two sites, with the growing chain being transferred from a D site onto the new unit at the R site to extend the chain and then back to the D site to repeat the process. It is proposed that the CLD protein and polymerase form a complex which has two states: 'E' facilitating extension and 'T' facilitating transfer to core. The complex is postulated to enter the E state as O-antigen polymerization starts, and to shift to the T state after a predetermined time, the CLD acting as a molecular clock. The CLD is not O-antigen or species-specific but the modal value does depend on the source of the cld gene.},

	abstract = {Mucoviscosity-associated gene A (magA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae contributes to K1 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. Based on sequence homology and gene alignment, the magA gene has been predicted to encode a Wzy-type CPS polymerase. Sequence alignment with the Wzy\_C and RfaL protein families (which catalyze CPS or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis) and topological analysis has suggested that eight highly conserved residues, including G308, G310, G334, G337, R290, P305, H323, and N324, were located in a hypothetical loop region. Therefore, we used site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of these residues in CPS production, and to observe the consequent phenotypes such as mucoviscosity, serum and phagocytosis resistance, and virulence (as assessed in mice) in pyogenic liver abscess strain NTUH-K2044. Alanine substitutions at R290 or H323 abolished all of these properties. The G308A mutant was severely impaired for these functions. The G334A mutant remained mucoid with decreased CPS production, but its virulence was significantly reduced in vivo. No phenotypic change was observed for strains harboring magA G310A, G337A, P305A, or N324A mutations. Therefore, R290, G308, H323, and G334 are functionally important residues of the MagA (Wzy) protein of K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044, capsular type K1. These amino acids are also likely to be important for the function of Wzy in other capsular types in K. pneumoniae and other species bearing Wzy\_C family proteins.},

              OST in distinct functional states. Our findings reveal that the terminal glucoses (Glc
              3
              ) of a chemo-enzymatically generated donor glycan analog bind to a pocket formed by the non-catalytic subunits WBP1 and OST2. We further find that binding either donor or acceptor substrate leads to distinct primed states of OST, where subsequent binding of the other substrate triggers conformational changes required for catalysis. This alternate priming allows OST to efficiently process closely spaced

              Genetic evidence suggests that a family of bacterial and eukaryotic integral
membrane proteins (referred to as Wzx and Rft1, respectively) mediates
the transbilayer movement of isoprenoid lipid-linked glycans. Recent
work in our laboratory has shown that Wzx proteins involved in
O-antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assembly have relaxed specificity
for the carbohydrate structure of the O-antigen subunit. Furthermore,
the proximal sugar bound to the isoprenoid lipid carrier,
undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P), is the minimal structure required for
translocation. In
              Escherichia coli
              K-12,
              N
              -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is the proximal sugar of
the O16 and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) subunits. Both O16 and
ECA systems have their respective translocases, Wzx
              O16
              and
Wzx
              E
              , and also corresponding polymerases (Wzy
              O16
              and Wzy
              E
              ) and O-antigen chain-length regulators
(Wzz
              O16
              and Wzz
              E
              ), respectively. In
this study, we show that the
              E. coli wzx
              E
              gene can
fully complement a
              wzx
              O16
              translocase deletion
mutant only if the majority of the ECA gene cluster is deleted. In
addition, we demonstrate that introduction of plasmids expressing
either the Wzy
              E
              polymerase or the Wzz
              E
              chain-length regulator proteins drastically reduces the O16
LPS-complementing activity of Wzx
              E
              . We also show that this
property is not unique to Wzx
              E
              , since Wzx
              O16
              and
Wzx
              O7
              can cross-complement translocase defects in the O16
and O7 antigen clusters only in the absence of their corresponding Wzz
and Wzy proteins. These genetic data are consistent with the notion
that the translocation of O-antigen and ECA subunits across the plasma
membrane and the subsequent assembly of periplasmic O-antigen and ECA
Und-PP-linked polymers depend on interactions among Wzx, Wzz, and Wzy,
which presumably form a multiprotein
complex.},

Previously, we found that interruption of ECA biosynthesis indirectly alters PG synthesis by sequestering Und-P via dead-end intermediates, causing morphological defects. To determine if competition for Und-P was a more general phenomenon, we determined if O-antigen intermediates caused similar effects. Indeed, disrupting the synthesis of O antigen or the lipopolysaccharide core oligosaccharide induced cell shape deformities, which were suppressed by preventing the initiation of O-antigen biosynthesis or by manipulating Und-P metabolism. We conclude that accumulation of O-antigen intermediates alters PG synthesis by sequestering Und-P. Importantly, many previous experiments addressed the physiological functions of various oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, but these studies employed mutants that accumulate deleterious intermediates. Thus, conclusions based on these experiments must be reevaluated to account for possible indirect effects of Und-P sequestration.},

To identify novel mechanisms that create or maintain cell shape in Escherichia coli, we used flow cytometry to screen a transposon insertion library and identified a wecE mutant that altered cell shape, causing cells to filament and swell. WecE is a sugar aminotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), a non-essential outer membrane glycolipid of the Enterobacteriaceae. Loss of wecE interrupts biosynthesis of ECA and causes the accumulation of the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate linked intermediate ECA-lipid II. The wecE shape defects were reversed by: (i) preventing initiation of ECA biosynthesis, (ii) increasing the synthesis of the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP), (iii) diverting Und-P to PG synthesis, or (iv) promoting Und-P recycling. The results argue that the buildup of ECA-lipid II sequesters part of the pool of Und-P, which, in turn, adversely affects PG synthesis. The data strongly suggests there is competition for a common pool of Und-P, whose proper distribution to alternate metabolic pathways is required to maintain normal cell shape in E. coli.},

	abstract = {The ability of bacteria to synthesize complex polysaccharide chains at a controlled number of repeating units has wide implications for a range of biological activities that include symbiosis, bioﬁlm formation, and immune system avoidance. Complex polysaccharide chains, such as the O antigen (Oag) component of lipopolysaccharide and the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), are synthesized by the most common polysaccharide synthesis pathway used in bacteria, known as the Wzy-dependent pathway. The Oag and ECA are polymerized into chains via the inner membrane proteins WzyB and WzyE, respectively, while the respective copolymerases WzzB and WzzE modulate the number of repeat units in the chains, or the “modal length” of the polysaccharide, via a hypothesized interaction. Our data, show for the ﬁrst time, “cross talk” between Oag and ECA synthesis in that WzzE is able to partially regulate Oag modal length via a potential interaction with WzyB. To investigate this, one or both of the transmembrane regions (TM1 and TM2) of WzzE and WzzB were swapped, creating six chimera proteins. Several chimeric proteins showed signiﬁcant increases in Oag modal length control, while others reduced control. Additionally, copuriﬁcation experiments show an interaction between WzyB and WzzB for the ﬁrst time without the use of a chemical cross-linker, and a novel interaction between WzyB and WzzE. These results suggest the TM2 region of Wzz proteins plays a critical role in Oag and ECA modal length control, presumably via the interaction with respective Wzy proteins, thus providing insight into the complex mechanism underlying the control of polysaccharide biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli group I capsular K antigens are found in two forms on the cell surface. The KLPS form is linked to lipopolysaccharide lipid A core, whereas the high-molecular-weight capsular form is assembled independently of lipid A core. Subgroup IB K antigens are generally co-expressed with either the O8 or O9 antigen and, under the appropriate conditions, with the exopolysaccharide, colanic acid. To examine the relationships between the genetic loci and the synthetic pathways for these various cell-surface polymers, the gene cluster responsible for expression of a prototype group IB K antigen (serotype K40) was cloned and the ﬂanking chromosomal regions characterized. Analysis of the six orfs within the cluster indicates features typical of Wzy (Rfc)-dependent O antigens. Synthesis of group IB K antigens is initiated by WecA (Rfe), a UDP-GlcNAc::undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase, and the chain length of K40LPS is determined by the wzz gene product. The his-region of the E. coli O8:K40 prototype is almost exclusively devoted to the expression of three different surface polysaccharides. The rfbK40 cluster is located adjacent to the cps (colanic acid synthesis) and rfbO8 (O8 antigen synthesis) loci in the gene order: his-rfbO8/O9–wzz –ugd –gnd –rfbK40–galF –cps. Thus, rfbK40 is in the location occupied by other Wzy-dependent rfb gene clusters, and rfbO8/O9 represents an additional locus.},

Freezeetchings of ferritin-labeled strains showed a dense labeling of the outer membrane in case of ECA-immunogenic strains, an essentially weaker labeling of the non-immunogenic ECA mutant and, as expected, no labeling of ECA-negative mutants. Comparable results were obtained with the indirect immunofluorescence technique: the whole cell envelope of strain F470 showed a brilliant fluorescence, whereas a much lesser, spotty distribution of fluorescence was noted with strain F614 and none at all was noted with the ECA-negative strains.

            Multiple sequence alignments are widely used to infer evolutionary relationships, enabling inferences of structure, function, and phylogeny. Standard practice is to construct one alignment by some preferred method and use it in further analysis; however, undetected alignment bias can be problematic. I describe Muscle5, a novel algorithm which constructs an ensemble of high-accuracy alignment with diverse biases by perturbing a hidden Markov model and permuting its guide tree. Confidence in an inference is assessed as the fraction of the ensemble which supports it. Applied to phylogenetic tree estimation, I show that ensembles can confidently resolve topologies with low bootstrap according to standard methods, and conversely that some topologies with high bootstraps are incorrect. Applied to the phylogeny of RNA viruses, ensemble analysis shows that recently adopted taxonomic phyla are probably polyphyletic. Ensemble analysis can improve confidence assessment in any inference from an alignment.},

	abstract = {Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are complex glycolipids found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The lipid A–core component of the LPS molecule provides a versatile anchor to which a surface polymer:lipid A–core ligase enzyme can attach one or more structurally distinct surface polymers in a single bacterial strain. In some cases the same polymer can be found on the cell surface in both lipid A–core-linked and -unlinked forms. Analysis by SDS–PAGE of populations of LPS molecules extracted from bacterial cells indicates that there is extensive heterogeneity in their size distribution. Much of the heterogeneity results from complex modal distributions in the chain length of the polymers which are attached to lipid A–core. This is the result of preferential ligation of polymers with speciﬁc degrees of polymerization during the assembly of the LPS molecule. The surface architecture of the Gram-negative bacterial cell is therefore profoundly affected by the activities of the surface polymer:lipid A–core ligase and by molecular determinants of polymer chain length. Because of the involvement of cell-surface polymers in interactions between pathogenic bacteria and their hosts, these enzymatic activities also have an important impact on virulence. In this review, the organization of LPSs and related surface polymers will be described and the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in surface diversity will be discussed. Emphasis is placed on the Enterobacteriaceae, but similarities to other bacteria suggest that aspects of the enterobacterial system will have broader signiﬁcance.},

The first two of these, which encode proteins of 27,441 and 32,890 Da, were identified as rfaY and rfaZ by homology of the derived protein sequences of their products to the products of similar genes of Salmonella typhimurium. The amino acid sequences of proteins RfaY and RfaZ showed, respectively, 70 and 72\% identity. Genes 3 and 4 were identified as rfaK and rfaL on the basis of size and position, but the derived amino acid sequences of the products of these genes showed very little similarity (about 12\% identity) between Escherichia coli K-12 and S. typhimurium. The next gene in the cluster, rfaC, encodes a product which also shows strong protein sequence homology between E. coli K-12 and S. typhimurium, as do the rfaF and rfaD genes which lie beyond it. Thus, the rfa gene cluster appears to consist of two blocks of genes which are conserved flanking a central region of two genes which are not conserved between these species. Although the RfaL protein sequence is not conserved, hydropathy plots of the two RfaL species are nearly identical and indicate that this is a typical integral membrane protein with 10 or more potential transmembrane domains. We noted the similarity of the structure of the rfa gene cluster to that of the rfb gene cluster, which has now been sequenced in several Salmonella serovars. The rfb cluster also contains a gene which lies within a central nonconserved region and encodes an integral membrane protein similar to protein RfaL. We speculate that protein RfaL may interact in a strain- or species-specific way with one or more Rfb proteins in the expression of surface O antigen.},

Diverse covalent modiﬁcations of the lipid A moiety may occur during its transit from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer membrane. Lipid A modiﬁcation enzymes are reporters for lipopolysaccharide trafﬁcking within the bacterial envelope. Modiﬁcation systems are variable and often regulated by environmental conditions. Although not required for growth, the modiﬁcation enzymes modulate virulence of some gram-negative pathogens.

              Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the final, essential reactions of peptidoglycan synthesis. Three classes of PBPs catalyze either trans-, endo-, or carboxypeptidase activities on the peptidoglycan peptide side chains. Only the class A high-molecular-weight PBPs have clearly demonstrated glycosyltransferase activities that polymerize the glycan strands, and in some species these proteins have been shown to be essential. The
              Bacillus subtilis
              genome sequence contains four genes encoding class A PBPs and no other genes with similarity to their glycosyltransferase domain. A strain lacking all four class A PBPs has been constructed and produces a peptidoglycan wall with only small structural differences from that of the wild type. The growth rate of the quadruple mutant is much lower than those of strains lacking only three of the class A PBPs, and increases in cell length and frequencies of wall abnormalities were noticeable. The viability and wall production of the quadruple-mutant strain indicate that a novel enzyme can perform the glycosyltransferase activity required for peptidoglycan synthesis. This activity was demonstrated in vitro and shown to be sensitive to the glycosyltransferase inhibitor moenomycin. In contrast, the quadruple-mutant strain was resistant to moenomycin in vivo. Exposure of the wild-type strain to moenomycin resulted in production of a phenotype similar to that of the quadruple mutant.},

Three O antigen biosynthesis pathways including Wzx/Wzy, ABC-transporter and Synthase have been discovered.

The dynamic programming algorithm results in a glycan profile of the alignment glycans, containing "monosaccharide positions" indicating the ratio of monosaccharides and their glycosidic bonds that are aligned at the corresponding position. This tool has been used to analyze databases of glycan array experimental data, incorporating weights to reflect the biological significance of certain glycans over others.

We demonstrate that the activity of two distantly related O antigen ligases is dependent on the presence of N-acetylglucosamine, and substitution of an additional sugar, i.e. galactose, alters the site specificity of the core oligosaccharide necessitating discriminative WaaL types. Protein topology analysis and a conserved domain search identified two distinct conserved motifs in the periplasmic domains of WaaL proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the two motifs, shown for WaaLs of V. cholerae and Salmonella enterica, caused a loss of O antigen transfer activity. Moreover, analogy of topology and motifs between WaaLs and O polysaccharide polymerases (Wzy) reveals a relationship between the two protein families, suggesting that the catalyzed reactions are related to each other.},

	abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is a notorious bacterium in clinical practice. Virulence, carbapenem-r­esistance and their convergence among K. pneumoniae are extensively discussed in this article. Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP) has spread from the Asian Pacific Rim to the world, inducing various invasive infections, such as pyogenic liver abscess, endophthalmitis, and meningitis. Furthermore, HvKP has acquired more and more drug resistance. Among multidrug-­resistant HvKP, hypervirulent carbapenem-­resistant K. pneumoniae (Hv-­CRKP), and carbapenem-r­ esistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-­HvKP) are both devastating for their extreme drug resistance and virulence. The hypervirulence of HvKP is primarily attributed to hypercapsule, macromolecular exopolysaccharides, or excessive siderophores, although it has many other factors, for example, lipopolysaccharides, fimbriae, and porins. In contrast with classical determination of HvKP, that is, animal lethality test, molecular determination could be an optional and practical method after improvement. HvKP, including Hv-­CRKP and CR-­HvKP, has been progressing. R-­M and CRISPR-Cas systems may play pivotal roles in such evolutions. Hv-­CRKP and CR-­HvKP, in particular the former, should be of severe concern due to their being more and more prevalent.},

Recent genomic data have facilitated study of LPS assembly in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human or plant pathogens, and have established the importance of lateral gene transfer in generating structural diversity of O-antigens. Many enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis like LpxC have been validated as targets for development of new antibiotics. Key genes for lipid A biosynthesis have unexpectedly also been found in higher plants, indicating that eukaryotic lipid A-like molecules may exist. Most significant has been the identification of the plasma membrane protein TLR4 as the lipid A signaling receptor of animal cells. TLR4 belongs to a family of innate immunity receptors that possess a large extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats, a single trans-membrane segment, and a smaller cytoplasmic signaling region that engages the adaptor protein MyD88. The expanding knowledge of TLR4 specificity and its downstream signaling pathways should provide new opportunities for blocking inflammation associated with infection.},

In addition, chase of the monomeric O-specific tetrasaccharide unit into lipopolysaccharide was found in similar experiments in an O-polymerase-negative [rfc kdsA(Ts) pmi] mutant, suggesting that polymerization of O chains also occurs at the external face of the inner membrane.},

O-reactive lipopolysaccharide appeared rapidly at the exposed periplasmic face of the inner membrane after addition of galactose and was rapidly depleted upon termination of the pulse. Control experiments showed that secondary redistribution of lipopolysaccharide from outer membrane did not occur under the conditions employed for spheroplast formation and immunolabeling, and the pulse-chase kinetics were consistent with those expected for an intermediate in translocation of lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane. In addition, undecaprenol-linked 0 antigen was detectable at the periplasmic face of the inner membrane within 30 sec after addition ofgalactose to a galE deep rough double mutant, and it accumulated stably in that location. The mutation in synthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core in the deep rough strain prevents transfer of O-antigen chains from undecaprenol phosphate to lipopolysaccharide. The result suggests that attachment of 0 antigen to lipopolysaccharide occurs on the extracytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and supports the conclusion that lipopolysaccharide is translocated to the outer membrane from the periplasmic, rather than the cytoplasmic, face of the inner membrane.},

              The O-antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) represents a population of polysaccharide molecules with nonrandom (modal) chain length distribution. The number of the repeat O units in each individual O-antigen polymer depends on the Wzz chain length regulator, an inner membrane protein belonging to the polysaccharide copolymerase (PCP) family. Different Wzz proteins confer vastly different ranges of modal lengths (4 to {\textgreater}100 repeat units), despite having remarkably conserved structural folds. The molecular mechanism responsible for the selective preference for a certain number of O units is unknown. Guided by the three-dimensional structures of PCPs, we constructed a panel of chimeric molecules containing parts of two closely related Wzz proteins from
              Salmonella enterica
              and
              Shigella flexneri
              which confer different O-antigen chain length distributions. Analysis of the O-antigen length distribution imparted by each chimera revealed the region spanning amino acids 67 to 95 (region 67 to 95), region 200 to 255, and region 269 to 274 as primarily affecting the length distribution. We also showed that there is no synergy between these regions. In particular, region 269 to 274 also influenced chain length distribution mediated by two distantly related PCPs, WzzB and FepE. Furthermore, from the 3 regions uncovered in this study, region 269 to 274 appeared to be critical for the stability of the oligomeric form of Wzz, as determined by cross-linking experiments. Together, our data suggest that chain length determination depends on regions that likely contribute to stabilize a supramolecular complex.},

	abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component on the surface of Gram negative bacteria and is composed of lipid A-core and the O antigen polysaccharide. O polysaccharides of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori contain Lewis antigens, mimicking glycan structures produced by human cells. The interaction of Lewis antigens with human dendritic cells induces a modulation of the immune response, contributing to the H. pylori virulence. The amount and position of Lewis antigens in the LPS varies among H. pylori isolates, indicating an adaptation to the host. In contrast to most bacteria, the genes for H. pylori O antigen biosynthesis are spread throughout the chromosome, which likely contributed to the fact that the LPS assembly pathway remained uncharacterized. In this study, two enzymes typically involved in LPS biosynthesis were found encoded in the H. pylori genome; the initiating glycosyltransferase WecA, and the O antigen ligase WaaL. Fluorescence microscopy and analysis of LPS from H. pylori mutants revealed that WecA and WaaL are involved in LPS production. Activity of WecA was additionally demonstrated with complementation experiments in Escherichia coli. WaaL ligase activity was shown in vitro. Analysis of the H. pylori genome failed to detect a flippase typically involved in O antigen synthesis. Instead, we identified a homolog of a flippase involved in protein N-glycosylation in other bacteria, although this pathway is not present in H. pylori. This flippase named Wzk was essential for O antigen display in H. pylori and was able to transport various glycans in E. coli. Whereas the O antigen mutants showed normal swimming motility and injection of the toxin CagA into host cells, the uptake of DNA seemed to be affected. We conclude that H. pylori uses a novel LPS biosynthetic pathway, evolutionarily connected to bacterial protein N-glycosylation.},

We determined the periplasmic location of a large (EL5) and small (EL4) adjacent loops in the Escherichia coli K-12 WaaL. Structural models of the EL5 from the K-12, R1 and R4 E. coli ligases were generated by molecular dynamics. Despite the poor amino acid sequence conservation among these proteins, the models afforded similar folds consisting of two pairs of almost perpendicular a-helices. One a-helix in each pair contributes a histidine and an arginine facing each other, which are highly conserved in WaaL homologues. Mutations in either residue rendered WaaL non-functional, since mutant proteins were unable to restore O antigen surface expression. Replacements of residues located away from the putative catalytic centre and non-conserved residues within the centre itself did not affect ligation. Furthermore, replacing a highly conserved arginine in EL4 with various amino acids inactivates WaaL function, but functionality reappears when the positive charge is restored by a replacement with lysine. These results lead us to propose that the conserved amino acids in the two adjacent periplasmic loops could interact with Und-PP, which is the common component in all WaaL substrates.},

It protects the cell against host defenses or physical environmental stresses, such as desiccation. The component capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are major surface antigens in E. coli. They are named K antigens (after the German word Kapsel). Due to variations in CPS structures, more than 80 serologically unique K antigens exist in E. coli. Despite the hypervariability in CPS structures, only two capsule-assembly strategies exist in E. coli. These have led to the assignment of group 1 and group 2 capsules, and many of the key elements of the corresponding assembly pathways have been resolved. Structural features, as well as genetic and regulatory variations, give rise to additional groups 3 and 4. These employ the same biosynthesis processes described in groups 2 and 1, respectively. Each isolate possesses a distinctive set of cytosolic and inner-membrane enzymes, which generate a precise CPS structure, defining a given K serotype. Once synthesized, a multiprotein complex is needed to translocate the nascent CPS across the Gram-negative cell envelope to the outer surface of the outer membrane, where the capsule structure is assembled. While the translocation machineries for group 1 and group 2 CPSs are fundamentally different from one another, they possess no specificity for a given CPS structure. Each is conserved in all isolates producing capsules belonging to a particular group.},

	abstract = {The Pfam database is a widely used resource for classifying protein sequences into families and domains. Since Pfam was last described in this journal, over 350 new families have been added in Pfam 33.1 and numerous improvements have been made to existing entries. To facilitate research on COVID-19, we have revised the Pfam entries that cover the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, and built new entries for regions that were not covered by Pfam. We have reintroduced Pfam-B which provides an automatically generated supplement to Pfam and contains 136 730 novel clusters of sequences that are not yet matched by a Pfam family. The new Pfam-B is based on a clustering by the MMseqs2 software. We have compared all of the regions in the RepeatsDB to those in Pfam and have started to use the results to build and reﬁne Pfam repeat families. Pfam is freely available for browsing and download at http://pfam.xfam.org/.},

	abstract = {Colanic acid (CA) is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by most Escherichia coli strains as well as by other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We have determined the sequence of a 23-kb segment of the E. coli K-12 chromosome which includes the cluster of genes necessary for production of CA. The CA cluster comprises 19 genes. Two other sequenced genes (orf1.3 and galF), which are situated between the CA cluster and the O-antigen cluster, were shown to be unnecessary for CA production. The CA cluster includes genes for synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, one of the precursors of CA, and the gene for one of the enzymes in this pathway (GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase) was identified by biochemical assay. Six of the inferred proteins show sequence similarity to glycosyl transferases, and two others have sequence similarity to acetyl transferases. Another gene (wzx) is predicted to encode a protein with multiple transmembrane segments and may function in export of the CA repeat unit from the cytoplasm into the periplasm in a process analogous to O-unit export. The first three genes of the cluster are predicted to encode an outer membrane lipoprotein, a phosphatase, and an inner membrane protein with an ATP-binding domain. Since homologs of these genes are found in other extracellular polysaccharide gene clusters, they may have a common function, such as export of polysaccharide from the cell.},

	abstract = {The interaction between antibodies and antigens is one of the most important immune system mechanisms for clearing infectious organisms from the host. Antibodies bind to antigens at sites referred to as B-cell epitopes. Identification of the exact location of B-cell epitopes is essential in several biomedical applications such as; rational vaccine design, development of disease diagnostics and immunotherapeutics. However, experimental mapping of epitopes is resource intensive making in silico methods an appealing complementary approach. To date, the reported performance of methods for in silico mapping of B-cell epitopes has been moderate. Several issues regarding the evaluation data sets may however have led to the performance values being underestimated: Rarely, all potential epitopes have been mapped on an antigen, and antibodies are generally raised against the antigen in a given biological context not against the antigen monomer. Improper dealing with these aspects leads to many artificial false positive predictions and hence to incorrect low performance values. To demonstrate the impact of proper benchmark definitions, we here present an updated version of the DiscoTope method incorporating a novel spatial neighborhood definition and half-sphere exposure as surface measure. Compared to other state-of-the-art prediction methods, Discotope-2.0 displayed improved performance both in cross-validation and in independent evaluations. Using DiscoTope-2.0, we assessed the impact on performance when using proper benchmark definitions. For 13 proteins in the training data set where sufficient biological information was available to make a proper benchmark redefinition, the average AUC performance was improved from 0.791 to 0.824. Similarly, the average AUC performance on an independent evaluation data set improved from 0.712 to 0.727. Our results thus demonstrate that given proper benchmark definitions, B-cell epitope prediction methods achieve highly significant predictive performances suggesting these tools to be a powerful asset in rational epitope discovery.

	abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae
              typically express one of 92 serologically distinct capsule polysaccharide (cps) types (serotypes). Some of these serotypes are closely related to each other; using the commercially available typing antisera, these are assigned to common serogroups containing types that show cross-reactivity. In this serotyping scheme, factor antisera are used to allocate serotypes within a serogroup, based on patterns of reactions. This serotyping method is technically demanding, requires considerable experience and the reading of the results can be subjective. This study describes the analysis of the
              S. pneumoniae
              capsular operon genetic sequence to determine serotype distinguishing features and the development, evaluation and verification of an automated whole genome sequence (WGS)-based serotyping bioinformatics tool, PneumoCaT (

              psule
              T
              yping). Initially, WGS data from 871
              S. pneumoniae
              isolates were mapped to reference cps locus sequences for the 92 serotypes. Thirty-two of 92 serotypes could be unambiguously identified based on sequence similarities within the cps operon. The remaining 60 were allocated to one of 20 ‘genogroups’ that broadly correspond to the immunologically defined serogroups. By comparing the cps reference sequences for each genogroup, unique molecular differences were determined for serotypes within 18 of the 20 genogroups and verified using the set of 871 isolates. This information was used to design a decision-tree style algorithm within the PneumoCaT bioinformatics tool to predict to serotype level for 89/94 (92 + 2 molecular types/subtypes) from WGS data and to serogroup level for serogroups 24 and 32, which currently comprise 2.1\% of UK referred, invasive isolates submitted to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Public Health England (June 2014–July 2015). PneumoCaT was evaluated with an internal validation set of 2065 UK isolates covering 72/92 serotypes, including 19 non-typeable isolates and an external validation set of 2964 isolates from Thailand (
              n
              = 2,531), USA (
              n
              = 181) and Iceland (
              n
              = 252). PneumoCaT was able to predict serotype in 99.1\% of the typeable UK isolates and in 99.0\% of the non-UK isolates. Concordance was evaluated in UK isolates where further investigation was possible; in 91.5\% of the cases the predicted capsular type was concordant with the serologically derived serotype. Following retesting, concordance increased to 99.3\% and in most resolved cases (97.8\%; 135/138) discordance was shown to be caused by errors in original serotyping. Replicate testing demonstrated that PneumoCaT gave 100\% reproducibility of the predicted serotype result. In summary, we have developed a WGS-based serotyping method that can predict capsular type to serotype level for 89/94 serotypes and to serogroup level for the remaining four. This approach could be integrated into routine typing workflows in reference laboratories, reducing the need for phenotypic immunological testing.},

The previously unknown CPS structures of the pneumococcal serogroup 16 (serotypes 16F and 16A) were thoroughly elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and veriﬁed by chemical analysis. The following repeat unit structures were determined: 16F, -3)-␣-L-Rhap-[4-P-1-Gro](1-3)-␣-D-Glcp-[(6-P-1)-Gro]-(1-3)-␤-L-Rhap-[2-OAc]-(1-4)-␤-D-Glcp-(1-; 16A, -3)-␤-DGalf-[2-OAc (70\%)]-(1-3)-␣-L-Rhap-(1-2)-␣-L-Rhap-(1-3)-␣-D-Galp-[(6-P-1)-Gro]-(1-3)␤-D-Galp-(1-4)-␤-D-Glcp-(1- (OAc, O-acetyl substitution; P-1-Gro, glycerol-1-phosphate substitution). A further analysis of CPS biosynthesis of serotypes 16F and 16A, in conjunction with published cps gene bioinformatics analysis and structures of related serotypes, revealed presumable speciﬁc function of glycosyltransferase, acetyltransferase, phosphotransferase, and polymerase. The functions of glycosyltransferases WcxN and WcxT were proposed for the ﬁrst time, and they were assigned to catalyze linkage of ␣-L-Rhap-(1-3)-␣-D-Glcp and ␣-L-Rhap-(1-2)-␣-L-Rhap, respectively. Furthermore, since serotype 16F was genetically close to serogroup 28, cross-reactions between serogroup 16 and serogroup 28 were studied using diagnostic antisera, which provided further understanding of antigenic properties of CPS and diagnostic antisera. Interestingly, serotype 16F cross-reacted with factor antisera 28b and 11c. Meanwhile, serotype 16A crossreacted with factor antiserum 11c.},

	abstract = {Pneumococcal capsules are important in pneumococcal pathogenesis and vaccine development. Although conjugate vaccines have brought about a significant reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes, the relative serotype prevalence has shifted with the dramatic emergence of serotype 24F in some countries. Here, we describe 14 isolates (13 IPD and 1 non-IPD) expressing a new capsule type, 24C, which resembles 24F but has a novel serological proﬁle. We also describe the antigenic, biochemical, and genetic basis of 24F and 24C and the related serotypes 24A and 24B. Structural studies show that 24B, 24C, and 24F have identical polysaccharide backbones [b-Ribf-(1!4)-a-Rhap-(1!3)b-GlcpNAc-(1!4)-b-Rhap-(1!4)-b-Glcp] but with different side chains, as follows: 24F has arabinitol-phosphate and 24B has ribitol-phosphate. 24C has a mixture of 24F and 24B repeating units, with the ratio of ribitol to arabinitol being strain dependent. In contrast, the 24A capsule has a backbone without b-Ribf but with arabinitol-phosphate and phosphocholine side chains. These structures indicate that factor-sera 24d and 24e recognize arabinitol and ribitol, respectively, which explains the serology of serogroup 24, including those of 24C. The structures can be genetically described by the bispeciﬁcity of wcxG, which is capable of transferring arabinitol or ribitol when arabinitol is limiting. Arabinitol is likely not produced in 24B but is produced in reduced amounts in 24C due to various mutations in abpA or abpB genes. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how pneumococci modulate their capsule structure and immunologic properties with small genetic changes, thereby evading host immune responses. Our ﬁndings also suggest a potential for new capsule types within serogroup 24.},

              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort
              1–4
              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined
              5
              , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences
              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’
              8
              —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years
              9
              . Despite recent progress
              10–14
              , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

              Bacterial extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) play critical roles in virulence. Many bacteria assemble EPSs via a multi-protein “Wzx-Wzy” system, involving glycan polymerization at the outer face of the cytoplasmic/inner membrane. Gram-negative species couple polymerization with translocation across the periplasm and outer membrane and the master regulator of the system is the tyrosine autokinase, Wzc. This near atomic cryo-EM structure of dephosphorylated Wzc from
              E. coli
              shows an octameric assembly with a large central cavity formed by transmembrane helices. The tyrosine autokinase domain forms the cytoplasm region, while the periplasmic region contains small folded motifs and helical bundles. The helical bundles are essential for function, most likely through interaction with the outer membrane translocon, Wza. Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine-rich C-terminus of Wzc results in disassembly of the octamer into multiply phosphorylated monomers. We propose that the cycling between phosphorylated monomer and dephosphorylated octamer regulates glycan polymerization and translocation.},

              Capsular polysaccharides are important virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. Characterizing the structural components and biosynthetic pathways for these polysaccharides is key to our ability to design vaccines and other preventative therapies that target encapsulated pathogens. Many gram-negative pathogens such as
              Neisseria meningitidis
              and
              Escherichia coli
              express acidic capsules. The
              E. coli
              K15 serotype has been identified as both an enterotoxigenic and uropathogenic pathogen. Despite its relevance as a disease-causing serotype, the associated capsular polysaccharide remains poorly characterized. We describe in this report the chemical structure of the K15 polysaccharide, based on chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. The repeating structure of the K15 polysaccharide consists of 4)-α-Glc

In this Review, we will give the reader a third millennium update of the current knowledge of LPS with key information on the inherent peculiar carbohydrate chemistry due to often puzzling sugar residues that are uniquely found on it. Then, we will drive the reader through the complex and multifarious immunological outcomes that any given LPS can raise, which is strictly dependent on its chemical structure. Further, we will argue about issues that still remain unresolved and that would represent the immediate future of LPS research. It is critical to address these points to complete our notions on LPS chemistry, functions, and roles, in turn leading to innovative ways to manipulate the processes involving such a still controversial and intriguing biomolecule.},

It is now feasible to make efficient profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) searches via the web. A HMMER web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

              Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure

              2
              , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

This polysaccharide, commonly referred to as K4CP, is a potentially important source of precursors for chemoenzymatic or bioengineering synthesis of chondroitin sulfate. KfoA, encoded by a gene from region 2 of the K4 capsular gene cluster, shows high homology to the UDP-glucose-4-epimerase (GalE) from E. coli. KfoA is reputed to be responsible for uridine 5′-diphosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) supply for K4CP biosynthesis in vivo, but it has not been biochemically characterized. Here, we probed the substrate specificity of KfoA by a capillary electrophoresis (CE)based method. KfoA could epimerize both acetylated and non-acetylated substrates, but its kcat/Km value for UDP-GlcNAc was approximately 1300-fold that for UDP-Glc. Recombinant KfoA showed a strong preference for acetylated substrates in vitro. The conclusion that KfoA is a higher efficiency UDP-GalNAc provider than GalE was supported by a coupled assay developed based on the donor-acceptor combination specificity of E. coli K4 chondroitin polymerase (KfoC). Furthermore, residue Ser-301, located near the UDP-GlcNAc binding pocket, plays an important role in the determination of the conversion ratio of UDPGlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc by KfoA. Our results deepen the understanding of the mechanism of KfoA and will assist in the research into the metabolic engineering for chondroitin sulfate production.},

	abstract = {Background:  Insight into the function of carbohydrate-active enzymes is required to understand their biological role and industrial potential. There is a need for better use of the ample genomic data in order to enable selection of the most interesting proteins for further studies. The basis for elaborating a new approach to sequence analysis is the hypothesis that when using conserved peptide patterns to determine the similarities between proteins, the exact spacing between conserved adjacent amino acids in the proteins plays a prominent functional role. Thus, the objective of developing the method of conserved unique peptide patterns (CUPP) is to construct a peptide-based grouping and validate the method to provide evidence that CUPP captures function-related features of the individual carbohydrate-active enzymes (as defined by CAZy families). This approach facilitates grouping of enzymes at a level lower than protein families and/or subfamilies. A standardized, efficient, and robust approach to functional annotation of carbohydrate-active enzymes would support improved molecular insight into enzyme–substrate interaction.
Results:  A new nonalignment-based clustering and functional annotation tool was developed that uses conserved unique peptides patterns to perform automated clustering of proteins and formation of protein groups. A peptidebased model was constructed for each of these protein CUPP groups to be used to automatically annotate protein family, subfamily, and EC function of carbohydrate-active enzymes. CUPP prediction can annotate proteins (from any CAZy family) with high F-score to existing family (0.966), subfamily (0.961), and EC-function (0.843). The speed of the CUPP program was estimated and exemplified by prediction of the 504,017 nonredundant proteins of CAZy in less than four CPU hours.
Conclusion:  It was possible to construct an automated system for clustering proteins within families and use the resulting CUPP groups to directly build peptide-based models for genome annotation. The CUPP runtime, F-score, sensitivity, and precisions of family and subfamily annotations match or represent an improvement compared to state-of-the-art tools. The speed of the CUPP annotation is similar to the rapid DIAMOND annotation tool. CUPP facilitates automated annotation of full genome assemblies to any CAZy family.},

              Accurate and rapid typing of pathogens is essential for effective surveillance and outbreak detection. Conventional serotyping of
              Escherichia coli
              is a delicate, laborious, time-consuming, and expensive procedure. With whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becoming cheaper, it has vast potential in routine typing and surveillance. The aim of this study was to establish a valid and publicly available tool for WGS-based
              in silico
              serotyping of
              E. coli
              applicable for routine typing and surveillance. A FASTA database of specific O-antigen processing system genes for O typing and flagellin genes for H typing was created as a component of the publicly available Web tools hosted by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) (
              www.genomicepidemiology.org
              ). All
              E. coli
              isolates available with WGS data and conventional serotype information were subjected to WGS-based serotyping employing this specific SerotypeFinder CGE tool. SerotypeFinder was evaluated on 682
              E. coli
              genomes, 108 of which were sequenced for this study, where both the whole genome and the serotype were available. In total, 601 and 509 isolates were included for O and H typing, respectively. The O-antigen genes

              E. coli
              serotyping can be performed solely from WGS data, providing faster and cheaper typing than current routine procedures and making WGS typing a superior alternative to conventional typing strategies.},

	abstract = {Haemophilus inﬂuenzae exclusively colonizes the human nasopharynx and can cause a variety of respiratory infections as well as invasive diseases, including meningitis and sepsis. A key virulence determinant of H. inﬂuenzae is the polysaccharide capsule, of which six serotypes are known, each encoded by a distinct variation of the capsule biosynthesis locus (cap-a to cap-f). H. inﬂuenzae type b (Hib) was historically responsible for the majority of invasive H. inﬂuenzae disease, and its prevalence has been markedly reduced in countries that have implemented vaccination programs targeting this serotype. In the postvaccine era, nontypeable H. inﬂuenzae emerged as the most dominant group causing disease, but in recent years a resurgence of encapsulated H. inﬂuenzae strains has also been observed, most notably serotype a. Given the increasing incidence of encapsulated strains and the high frequency of Hib in countries without vaccination programs, there is growing interest in genomic epidemiology of H. inﬂuenzae. Here we present hicap, a software tool for rapid in silico serotype prediction from H. inﬂuenzae genome sequences. hicap is written using Python3 and is freely available at https://github.com/scwatts/hicap under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL3). To demonstrate the utility of hicap, we used it to investigate the cap locus diversity and distribution in 691 high-quality H. inﬂuenzae genomes from GenBank. These analyses identiﬁed cap loci in 95 genomes and conﬁrmed the general association of each serotype with a unique clonal lineage, and they also identiﬁed occasional recombination between lineages that gave rise to hybrid cap loci (2\% of encapsulated strains).},

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is a highly diverse subspecies with more than 1500 serovars and the ability to distinguish serovars within this group is vital for surveillance. With the development of whole-genome sequencing technology, serovar prediction by traditional serotyping is being replaced by molecular serotyping. Existing in silico serovar prediction approaches utilize surface antigen encoding genes, core genome MLST and serovar-speciﬁc gene markers or DNA fragments for serotyping. However, these serovar-speciﬁc gene markers or DNA fragments only distinguished a small number of serovars. In this study, we compared 2258 Salmonella accessory genomes to identify 414 candidate serovar-speciﬁc or lineage-speciﬁc gene markers for 106 serovars which includes 24 polyphyletic serovars and the paraphyletic serovar Enteritidis. A combination of several lineage-speciﬁc gene markers can be used for the clear identiﬁcation of the polyphyletic serovars and the paraphyletic serovar. We designed and evaluated an in silico serovar prediction approach by screening 1089 genomes representing 106 serovars against a set of 131 serovar-speciﬁc gene markers. The presence or absence of one or more serovar-speciﬁc gene markers was used to predict the serovar of an isolate from genomic data. We show that serovar-speciﬁc gene markers have comparable accuracy to other in silico serotyping methods with 84.8\% of isolates assigned to the correct serovar with no false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) and 10.5\% of isolates assigned to a small subset of serovars containing the correct serovar with varied FP. Combined, 95.3\% of genomes were correctly assigned to a serovar. This approach would be useful as diagnosis moves to culture-independent and metagenomic methods as well as providing a third alternative to conﬁrm other genome-based analyses. The identiﬁcation of a set of gene markers may also be useful in the development of more cost-effective molecular assays designed to detect speciﬁc gene markers of the all major serovars in a region. These assays would be useful in serotyping isolates where cultures are no longer obtained and traditional serotyping is therefore impossible.},

              Salmonella enterica
              is the second most reported bacterial cause of food-borne infections in Europe. Therefore molecular surveillance activities based on pathogen subtyping are an important measure of controlling Salmonellosis by public health agencies. In Germany, at the federal level, this work is carried out by the National Reference Center for
              Salmonella
              and other Bacterial Enteric Pathogens (NRC). With rise of next generation sequencing techniques, the NRC has introduced whole-genome-based typing methods for
              S. enterica
              in 2016. In this study we report on the feasibility of genome-based
              in silico
              serotyping in the German setting using raw sequence reads. We found that SeqSero and seven gene MLST showed 98\% and 95\% concordance, respectively, with classical serotyping for the here evaluated serotypes, including the most common German serotypes

              S

              in silico

Classical Shigella identiﬁcation based on selective media and serology is tedious, time-consuming, expensive, and not always accurate. A molecular diagnostic assay does not distinguish Shigella at the species level or from enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC). We inspected genomic sequences from 221 Shigella isolates and observed low concordance rates between conventional designation and molecular serotyping: 86.4\% and 80.5\% at the species and serotype levels, respectively. Serotype determinants for 6 additional serotypes were identiﬁed. Examination of differentiation gene markers commonly perceived as characteristic hallmarks in Shigella showed high variability among different serotypes. Using this information, we developed ShigaTyper, an automated workﬂow that utilizes limited computational resources to accurately and rapidly determine 59 Shigella serotypes using Illumina paired-end whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads. Shigella serotype determinants and species-speciﬁc diagnostic markers were ﬁrst identiﬁed through read alignment to an in-house curated reference sequence database. Relying on sequence hits that passed a threshold level of coverage and accuracy, serotype could be unambiguously predicted within 1 min for an average-size WGS sample of ϳ500 MB. Validation with WGS data from 380 isolates showed an accuracy rate of 98.2\%. This pipeline is the ﬁrst step toward building a comprehensive WGS-based analysis pipeline of Shigella spp. in a ﬁeld laboratory setting, where speed is essential and resources need to be more cost-effectively dedicated.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
              Many bacteria export extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS). These polymers exhibit remarkably diverse structures and play important roles in the biology of free-living, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. EPS and CPS production represents a major challenge because these high-molecular-weight hydrophilic polymers must be assembled and exported in a process spanning the envelope, without compromising the essential barrier properties of the envelope. Emerging evidence points to the existence of molecular scaffolds that perform these critical polymer-trafficking functions. Two major pathways with different polymer biosynthesis strategies are involved in the assembly of most EPS/CPS: the Wzy-dependent and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathways. They converge in an outer membrane export step mediated by a member of the outer membrane auxiliary (OMA) protein family. OMA proteins form outer membrane efflux channels for the polymers, and here we propose the revised name outer membrane polysaccharide export (OPX) proteins. Proteins in the polysaccharide copolymerase (PCP) family have been implicated in several aspects of polymer biogenesis, but there is unequivocal evidence for some systems that PCP and OPX proteins interact to form a trans-envelope scaffold for polymer export. Understanding of the precise functions of the OPX and PCP proteins has been advanced by recent findings from biochemistry and structural biology approaches and by parallel studies of other macromolecular trafficking events. Phylogenetic analyses reported here also contribute important new insight into the distribution, structural relationships, and function of the OPX and PCP proteins. This review is intended as an update on progress in this important area of microbial cell biology.},

Here we report the DNA sequence and molecular analysis of the B-band O-antigen biosynthetic cluster.

In contrast, wbpM and wbpN are common to all 20 serotypes of P. aeruginosa. Although wbpM is not serogroup-speciﬁc, knockout mutations conﬁrmed it is necessary for O5 O-antigen biosynthesis. A novel insertion sequence, IS1209, is present at the junction between the serogroup-speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc regions.

              The estuarine bacterium
              Vibrio vulnificus
              is a human and animal pathogen. The expression of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is essential for virulence. We used a new mini-Tn
              10
              delivery vector, pNKTXI-SceI, to generate a mutant library and identify genes essential for CPS biosynthesis. Twenty-one acapsular mutants were isolated, and the disrupted gene in one mutant, coding for a polysaccharide polymerase (
              wzy
              ), is described here. A
              wecA
              gene initiating glycosyltransferase was among the genes identified in the region flanking the
              wzy
              gene. This, together with the known structure of the CPS, supports a group IV capsule designation for the locus; however, its overall organization mirrored that of group I capsules. This new arrangement may be linked to our finding that the CPS region appears to have been recently acquired by horizontal transfer. Alcian Blue staining and immunoblotting with antisera against the wild-type strain indicated that the
              wzy
              ::Tn
              10
              mutant failed to produce CPS and was attenuated relative to the wild type in a septicemic mouse model. Interestingly, immunoblotting revealed that the mutant was also defective in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production. However, the core-plus-one O-antigen pattern typical of
              wzy
              mutations was apparent. CPS production, LPS production, and virulence were restored following complementation with the wild-type
              wzy
              gene. Hence, Wzy participates in both CPS and LPS biosynthesis and is required for virulence in strain 27562. To our knowledge, this is the first functional demonstration of a Wzy polysaccharide polymerase in
              V. vulnificus
              and is the first to show a link between LPS and CPS biosynthesis.},

We demonstrate that the activity of the Escherichia coli O-antigen polymerase (Wzy) is dependent on the first sugar of the O-antigen repeat unit to produce the O-antigen polymerization and therefore, there is a need for a concerted action with the enzyme transferring the initial HexNAc to undecaprenyl phosphate (UDP-HexNAc: polyprenol-P HexNAc-1-P transferase).

The variation in structures underpins the serological speciﬁcity of the 46 recognized serogroups. The O antigen is important for the full function and virulence of many bacteria, and the considerable diversity of O antigens can confer selective advantage. Salmonella O antigens can be divided into two major groups: those which have N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and those which have galactose (Gal) as the ﬁrst sugar in the O unit. In recent years, we have determined 21 chemical structures and sequenced 28 gene clusters for GlcNAc-/GalNAc-initiated O antigens, thus completing the structure and DNA sequence data for the 46 Salmonella O antigens. The structures and gene clusters of the GlcNAc-/GalNAc-initiated O antigens were found to be highly diverse, and 24 of them were found to be identical or closely related to Escherichia coli O antigens. Sequence comparisons indicate that all or most of the shared gene clusters were probably present in the common ancestor, although alternative explanations are also possible. In contrast, the better-known eight Gal-initiated O antigens are closely related both in structures and gene cluster sequences.},

Serogroups A, B1, B2, C2-C3, D1, D2, D3 and E have O antigens that are distinguished by having galactose as first sugar, and not N-acetyl glucosamine or Nacetyl galactosamine as in the other 38 serogroups, and indeed in most Enterobacteriaceae. The gene clusters for these galactose-initiated appear to have entered S. enterica since its divergence from E. coli, but sequence comparisons show that much of the diversification occurred long before this. We conclude that the gene clusters must have entered S. enterica in a series of parallel events. The individual gene clusters are discussed, followed by analysis of the divergence for those genes shared by two or more gene clusters, and a putative phylogenic tree for the gene clusters is presented. This set of O antigens provides a rare case where it is possible to examine in detail the relationships of a significant number of O antigens. In contrast the more common pattern of O-antigen diversity within a species is for there to be only a few cases of strains having related gene clusters, suggesting that diversity arose through gain of individual O-antigen gene clusters by lateral gene transfer, and under these circumstances the evolution of the diversity is not accessible. This paper on the galactose-initiated set of gene clusters gives new insights into the origins of O-antigen diversity generally.},

To support the study of sequence-structure-function relationships and the search for novel expansins, the Expansin Engineering Database (ExED, https://exed.biocatnet.de) collected sequence and structure data on expansins from Bacteria, Fungi, and Viridiplantae, and expansin-like homologues such as carbohydrate binding modules, glycoside hydrolases, loosenins, swollenins, cerato-platanins, and EXPNs. Based on global sequence alignment and protein sequence network analysis, the sequences are highly diverse. However, many similarities were found between the expansin domains. Newly created profile hidden Markov models of the two expansin domains enable standard numbering schemes, comprehensive conservation analyses, and genome annotation. Conserved key amino acids in the expansin domains were identified, a refined classification of expansins and carbohydrate binding modules was proposed, and new sequence motifs facilitate the search of novel candidate genes and the engineering of expansins.},

Nonetheless, the similarity of the levels of divergence in the five gene clusters required us to consider the possibility that the parent gene cluster for each structure was in the common ancestor of the species and that divergence is faster than expected for the common ancestor hypothesis. We propose that the identical O-antigen gene clusters originated from a common ancestor, and we discuss some possible explanations for the increased rate of divergence that is seen in these genes.},

Recent work has shown that PglF, a protein with homology to O-antigen ‘ﬂippases’, is required for the biosynthesis of the pilin-linked glycan and suggests pilin glycosylation occurs in a manner analogous to the wzy-dependent addition of O-antigen to the core-LPS. O-Antigen ligases are crucial in this pathway for the transfer of undecraprenol-linked sugars to the LPS-core in Gram-negative bacteria. An O-antigen ligase homologue, pglL, was identiﬁed in N. meningitidis. PglL mutants showed no change in LPS phenotypes but did show loss of pilin glycosylation, conﬁrming PglL is essential for pilin O-linked glycosylation in N. meningitidis.},

	abstract = {Bacterial capsules and lipopolysaccharides are diverse surface polysaccharides (SPs) that serve as the frontline for interactions with the outside world. While SPs can evolve rapidly, their diversity and evolutionary dynamics across different taxonomic scales has not been investigated in detail. Here, we focused on the bacterial order Enterobacteriales (including the medically relevant Enterobacteriaceae), to carry out comparative genomics of two SP locus synthesis regions, cps and kps, using 27,334 genomes from 45 genera. We identiﬁed high-quality cps loci in 22 genera and kps in 11 genera, around 4\% of which were detected in multiple species. We found SP loci to be highly dynamic genetic entities: their evolution was driven by high rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), both of whole loci and component genes, and relaxed purifying selection, yielding large repertoires of SP diversity. In spite of that, we found the presence of (near-)identical locus structures in distant taxonomic backgrounds that could not be explained by recent exchange, pointing to long-term selective preservation of locus structures in some populations. Our results reveal differences in evolutionary dynamics driving SP diversity within different bacterial species, with lineages of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter hormaechei and Klebsiella aerogenes most likely to share SP loci via recent exchange; and lineages of Salmonella enterica, Cronobacter sakazakii and Serratia marcescens most likely to share SP loci via other mechanisms such as long-term preservation. Overall, the evolution of SP loci in Enterobacteriales is driven by a range of evolutionary forces and their dynamics and relative importance varies between different species.},

	abstract = {Background: Transmembrane helices (TMHs) frequently occur amongst protein architectures as means for proteins to attach to or embed into biological membranes. Physical constraints such as the membrane’s hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential apply uniform requirements to TMHs and their flanking regions; consequently, they are mirrored in their sequence patterns (in addition to TMHs being a span of generally hydrophobic residues) on top of variations enforced by the specific protein’s biological functions.
Results: With statistics derived from a large body of protein sequences, we demonstrate that, in addition to the positive charge preference at the cytoplasmic inside (positive-inside rule), negatively charged residues preferentially occur or are even enriched at the non-cytoplasmic flank or, at least, they are suppressed at the cytoplasmic flank (negative-not-inside/negative-outside (NNI/NO) rule). As negative residues are generally rare within or near TMHs, the statistical significance is sensitive with regard to details of TMH alignment and residue frequency normalisation and also to dataset size; therefore, this trend was obscured in previous work. We observe variations amongst taxa as well as for organelles along the secretory pathway. The effect is most pronounced for TMHs from single-pass transmembrane (bitopic) proteins compared to those with multiple TMHs (polytopic proteins) and especially for the class of simple TMHs that evolved for the sole role as membrane anchors.
Conclusions: The charged-residue flank bias is only one of the TMH sequence features with a role in the anchorage mechanisms, others apparently being the leucine intra-helix propensity skew towards the cytoplasmic side, tryptophan flanking as well as the cysteine and tyrosine inside preference. These observations will stimulate new prediction methods for TMHs and protein topology from a sequence as well as new engineering designs for artificial membrane proteins.},

The long and complex evolution of this family of enzymes and its broad sequence diversity limits functional prediction. With the objective of improving the differentiation of enzyme specificities in a knowledge-based context, and to obtain new evolutionary insights, we present here a new, robust subfamily classification of family GH5.
Results: About 80\% of the current sequences were assigned into 51 subfamilies in a global analysis of all publicly available GH5 sequences and associated biochemical data. Examination of subfamilies with catalytically-active members revealed that one third are monospecific (containing a single enzyme activity), although new functions may be discovered with biochemical characterization in the future. Furthermore, twenty subfamilies presently have no characterization whatsoever and many others have only limited structural and biochemical data. Mapping of functional knowledge onto the GH5 phylogenetic tree revealed that the sequence space of this historical and industrially important family is far from well dispersed, highlighting targets in need of further study. The analysis also uncovered a number of GH5 proteins which have lost their catalytic machinery, indicating evolution towards novel functions.
Conclusion: Overall, the subfamily division of GH5 provides an actively curated resource for large-scale protein sequence annotation for glycogenomics; the subfamily assignments are openly accessible via the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database at http://www.cazy.org/GH5.html.},

              O antigens are ubiquitous protective extensions of lipopolysaccharides in the extracellular leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane. Following biosynthesis in the cytosol, the lipid-linked polysaccharide is transported to the periplasm by the WzmWzt ABC transporter. Often, O antigen secretion requires the chemical modification of its elongating terminus, which the transporter recognizes via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD). Here, using components from
              A. aeolicus
              , we identify the O antigen structure with methylated mannose or rhamnose as its cap. Crystal and cryo electron microscopy structures reveal how WzmWzt recognizes this cap between its carbohydrate and nucleotide-binding domains in a nucleotide-free state. ATP binding induces drastic conformational changes of its CBD, terminating interactions with the O antigen. ATPase assays and site directed mutagenesis reveal reduced hydrolytic activity upon O antigen binding, likely to facilitate polymer loading into the ABC transporter. Our results elucidate critical steps in the recognition and translocation of polysaccharides by ABC transporters.},

              Escherichia coli
              O86:B7 has long been used as a model bacterial strain to study the generation of natural blood group antibody in humans, and it has been shown to possess high human blood B activity. The O-antigen structure of O86:B7 was solved recently in our laboratory. Comparison with the published structure of O86:H2 showed that both O86 subtypes shared the same O unit, yet each of the O antigens is polymerized from a different terminal sugar in a different glycosidic linkage. To determine the genetic basis for the O-antigen differences between the two O86 strains, we report the complete sequence of O86:B7 O-antigen gene cluster between
              galF
              and
              hisI
              , each gene was identified based on homology to other genes in the GenBank databases. Comparison of the two O86 O-antigen gene clusters revealed that the encoding regions between
              galF
              and
              gnd
              are identical, including
              wzy
              genes. However, deletion of the two
              wzy
              genes revealed that
              wzy
              in O86:B7 is responsible for the polymerization of the O antigen, while the deletion of
              wzy
              in O86:H2 has no effect on O-antigen biosynthesis. Therefore, we proposed that there must be another functional
              wzy
              gene outside the O86:H2 O-antigen gene cluster. Wzz proteins determine the degree of polymerization of the O antigen. When separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of O86:B7 exhibited a modal distribution of LPS bands with relatively short O units attached to lipid A-core, which differs from the LPS pattern of O86:H2. We proved that the
              wzz
              genes are responsible for the different LPS patterns found in the two O86 subtypes, and we also showed that the very short type of LPS is responsible for the serum sensitivity of the O86:B7 strain.},

Shigella ﬂexneri has two OM polysaccharide populations, being enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen (Oag); both are polymerized into chains by separate homologs of the Wzy-dependent pathway. The two polysaccharide pathways, along with peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis, compete for the universal biosynthetic membrane anchor, undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), as the ﬁnite pool of available Und-P is critical in all three cell wall biosynthetic pathways. Interactions between the two OM polysaccharide pathways have been proposed in the past where, through the use of mutants in both pathways, various perturbations have been observed. Here, we show for the ﬁrst time that mutations in one of the two OM polysaccharide pathways can affect each other, dependent on where the mutation lies along the pathway, while the second pathway remains genetically intact. We then expand on this and show that the mutations also affect PG biosynthesis pathways and provide data which supports that the classical mutant phenotypes of cell wall mutants are due to a lack of available Und-P. Our work here provides another layer in understanding the complex intricacies of the cell wall biosynthetic pathways and demonstrates their interdependence on Und-P, the universal biosynthetic membrane anchor.},

For an important ﬁrst step in deciphering the mechanisms of LPS assembly, we set out to map the membrane topology of these proteins. Random and targeted 3= wzx, wzy, and waaL truncations were fused to a phoA-lacZ␣ dual reporter capable of displaying both alkaline phosphatase and ␤-galactosidase activity. The results from truncation fusion expression and the corresponding differential enzyme activity ratios allowed for the assignment of speciﬁc regions of the proteins to cytoplasmic, transmembrane (TM), or periplasmic loci. Protein orientation in the inner membrane was conﬁrmed via C-terminal fusion to green ﬂuorescent protein. Our data revealed unique TM domain properties in these proteins, particularly for Wzx, indicating the potential for a charged pore. Novel periplasmic and cytoplasmic loop domains were also uncovered, with the latter in Wzy and WaaL revealing tracts consistent with potential Walker A/B motifs. IMPORTANCE The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes its virulence factor lipopolysaccharide via the Wzy-dependent pathway, requiring translocation, polymerization, and ligation of lipid-linked polysaccharide repeat units by the integral inner membrane proteins Wzx, Wzy, and WaaL, respectively. However, structural evidence to help explain the function of these proteins is lacking. Since membrane proteins are difﬁcult to crystallize, topological mapping is an important ﬁrst step in identifying exposed and membrane-embedded domains. We mapped the topologies of Wzx, Wzy, and WaaL from P. aeruginosa PAO1 by use of truncation libraries of a randomly fused C-terminal reporter capable of different enzyme activities in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Topology maps were created based directly on residue localization data, eliminating the bias associated with reliance on multiple topology prediction algorithms for initial generation of consensus transmembrane domain localizations. Consequently, we have identiﬁed novel periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and transmembrane domain properties that would help to explain the proposed functions of Wzx, Wzy, and WaaL.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The deluge of genomic data raises various challenges for computational protein annotation. The definition of superfamilies, based on conserved folds, or of families, showing more recent homology signatures, allow a first categorization of the sequence space. However, for precise functional annotation or the identification of the unexplored parts within a family, a division into subfamilies is essential. As curators of an expert database, the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (CAZy), we began, more than 15 years ago, to manually define subfamilies based on phylogeny reconstruction. However, facing the increasing amount of sequence and functional data, we required more scalable and reproducible methods. The recently popularized sequence similarity networks (SSNs), allows to cope with very large families and computation of many subfamily schemes. Still, the choice of the optimal SSN subfamily scheme only relies on expert knowledge so far, without any data-driven guidance from within the network. In this study, we therefore decided to investigate several network properties to determine a criterion which can be used by curators to evaluate the quality of subfamily assignments. The performance of the closeness centrality criterion, a network property to indicate the connectedness within the network, shows high similarity to the decisions of expert curators from eight distinct protein families. Closeness centrality also suggests that in some cases multiple levels of subfamilies could be possible, depending on the granularity of the research question, while it indicates when no subfamily emerged in some family evolution. We finally used closeness centrality to create subfamilies in four families of the CAZy database, providing a finer functional annotation and highlighting subfamilies without biochemically characterized members for potential future discoveries.
          
            Author Summary
            Proteins perform a lot of functions within living cells. To determining their broad function, we group similar amino-acid sequences into families as their shared ancestry argue for shared functionality. That’s what we do in the CAZy database, which covers {\textgreater}300 Cazbohydrate-Active enZyme families nowadays. However, we need to divide families into subfamilies to provide finer readibility into (meta)genomes and guide biochemists towards unexplored regions of the sequence space. We recently used the popularized Sequence Similarity Networks (SSN) to delineate subfamilies in the large GH16 family, but had to entirely rely on expert knowledge to evaluate and take the final decision until now, which is not scalable, not eough automated and less reproducible. To accelerate the construction of protein subfamilies from sequence similarity networks, we present here an investigation of different network properties, to use as indicators for optimal subfamily divisions. The closeness centrality criterion performed best on artificial data, and recapitulates the decisions of expert curators. We used this criterion to divide four more CAZy families into subfamilies, showed that for others no subfamilies exist.
            We are therefore able to create new protein subfamilies faster and with more reliability.},

These molecules are produced by most gram-negative bacteria, in which they play important roles in the integrity of the outer-membrane permeability barrier and participate extensively in host–pathogen interplay. Few bacteria contain lipopolysaccharide molecules composed only of lipid A. In most forms, lipid A is glycosylated by addition of the core oligosaccharide that, in some bacteria, provides an attachment site for a long-chain O-antigenic polysaccharide. The complexity of lipopolysaccharide structures is reﬂected in the processes used for their biosynthesis and export. Rapid growth and cell division depend on the bacterial cell’s capacity to synthesize and export lipopolysaccharide efﬁciently and in large amounts. We review recent advances in those processes, emphasizing the reactions that are essential for viability.},

PGTs comprise two distinct superfamilies of enzymes, and, although the ubiquitous polytopic PGTs exhibit a familiar multi-transmembrane helical structure, the strictly prokaryotic monotopic PGTs feature a core signature structure with a reentrant membrane helix and a highly conserved soluble domain. In the presented analysis these motifs provide a “lynch pin” for positively identifying over 38,000 nonredundant superfamily members and their genome neighborhoods. From this foundation, fusions of the monotopic PGT reveal insight into pathway function and regulation.

            The monotopic phosphoglycosyl transferase (monoPGT) superfamily comprises over 38,000 nonredundant sequences represented in bacterial and archaeal domains of life. Members of the superfamily catalyze the first membrane-committed step in en bloc oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathways, transferring a phosphosugar from a soluble nucleoside diphosphosugar to a membrane-resident polyprenol phosphate. The singularity of the monoPGT fold and its employment in the pivotal first membrane-committed step allows confident assignment of both protein and corresponding pathway. The diversity of the family is revealed by the generation and analysis of a sequence similarity network for the superfamily, with fusion of monoPGTs with other pathway members being the most frequent and extensive elaboration. Three common fusions were identified: sugar-modifying enzymes, glycosyl transferases, and regulatory domains. Additionally, unexpected fusions of the monoPGT with members of the polytopic PGT superfamily were discovered, implying a possible evolutionary link through the shared polyprenol phosphate substrate. Notably, a phylogenetic reconstruction of the monoPGT superfamily shows a radial burst of functionalization, with a minority of members comprising only the minimal PGT catalytic domain. The commonality and identity of the fusion partners in the monoPGT superfamily is consistent with advantageous colocalization of pathway members at membrane interfaces.},

	abstract = {We have sequenced the gene clusters for type strains of the Acinetobacter baumannii serotyping scheme developed in the 1990s, and used the sequences to better understand diversity in surface polysaccharides of the genus. We obtained genome sequences for 27 available serovar type strains, and identified 25 polysaccharide gene cluster sequences. There are structures for 12 of these polysaccharides, and in general the genes present are appropriate to the structure where known. This greatly facilitates interpretation. We also find 53 different glycosyltransferase genes, and for 7 strains can provisionally allocate specific genes to all linkages. We identified primers that will distinguish the 25 sequence forms by PCR or microarray, or alternatively the genes can be used to determine serotype by ‘‘molecular serology’’. We applied the latter to 190 Acinetobacter genome-derived gene-clusters, and found 76 that have one of the 25 gene-cluster forms. We also found novel gene clusters and added 52 new gene-cluster sequence forms with different wzy genes and different gene contents. Altogether, the strains that have one of the original 25 sequence forms include 98 A. baumannii (24 from our strains) and 5 A. nosocomialis (3 from our strains), whereas 32 genomes from 12 species other than A. baumannii or A. nosocomialis, all have new sequence forms. One of the 25 serovar type sequences is found to be in European clone I (EC I), 2 are in EC II but none in EC III. The public genome strains add an additional 52 new sequence forms, and also bring the number found in EC I to 5, in EC II to 9 and in EC III to 2.},

The combined CSDB includes information on bacterial and archaeal glycans and derivatives (the coverage is close to complete), as well as on plant and fungal glycans and glycoconjugates (almost all structures published up to 1998). CSDB is regularly updated via manual expert annotation of original publications. Both newly annotated data and data imported from other databases are manually curated.

	abstract = {The surfaces of bacteria mediate a multitude of functions in the environment and in an infected host, including adhesion to both biotic and abiotic substrata, motility, immune system interaction and (or) activation, bioﬁlm formation, and cell–cell communication, with many of these features directly inﬂuenced by cell-surface glycans. In both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, the majority of cell-surface polysaccharides are produced via the Wzx/Wzy-dependent assembly pathway; these glycans include heteropolymeric O-antigen, enterobacterial common antigen, exopolysaccharide, spore coat, and capsule in diverse bacteria. The key components of this assembly pathway are the integral inner membrane Wzx ﬂippase, Wzy polymerase, and Wzz chain-length regulator proteins, which until recently have resisted detailed structural and functional characterization. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive synthesis of the latest structural and mechanistic data for each protein, as well as an examination of substrate speciﬁcity for each assembly step and complex formation between the constituent proteins. To complement the unprecedented explosion of genomic-sequencing data for bacteria, we have also highlighted both classical and state-of-the-art methods by which encoded Wzx, Wzy, and Wzz proteins can be reliably identiﬁed and annotated, using the model Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an example data set. Lastly, we outline future avenues of research, with the aim of stimulating researchers to take the next steps in investigating the function of, and interplay between, the constituents of this widespread assembly scheme.},

	abstract = {Background: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.
Results: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.
Conclusion: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

	abstract = {The accuracy and scalability of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of DNAs and proteins have long been and are still important issues in bioinformatics. To rapidly construct a reasonable MSA, we developed the initial version of the MAFFT program in 2002. MSA software is now facing greater challenges in both scalability and accuracy than those of 5 years ago. As increasing amounts of sequence data are being generated by large-scale sequencing projects, scalability is now critical in many situations. The requirement of accuracy has also entered a new stage since the discovery of functional noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); the secondary structure should be considered for constructing a high-quality alignment of distantly related ncRNAs. To deal with these problems, in 2007, we updated MAFFT to Version 6 with two new techniques: the PartTree algorithm and the Four-way consistency objective function. The former improved the scalability of progressive alignment and the latter improved the accuracy of ncRNA alignment. We review these and other techniques that MAFFTuses and suggest possible future directions of MSA software as a basis of comparative analyses. MAFFT is available at http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software/.},
