Refining topology: 15 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 8 rounds ML-NNIs

ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -8335.947 NNIs 1 max delta 0.00 Time 0.12
      0.11 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.844 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
