      0.17 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.830 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
