Initial topology in 0.00 seconds
Refining topology: 15 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 7 rounds ML-NNIs

      0.10 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 17 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.768 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
