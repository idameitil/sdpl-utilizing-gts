Refining topology: 18 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 9 rounds ML-NNIs
      0.10 seconds: ME NNI round 13 of 18, 1 of 22 splits

      0.29 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.904 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
