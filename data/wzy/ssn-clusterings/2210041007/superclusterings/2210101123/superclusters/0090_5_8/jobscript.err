      1.54 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
      1.64 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 10 of 20
      1.75 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 19 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.931 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
