WARNINGS

One or more weights was less than -50 bits.
To avoid such amino acid dominating the logo position, these was reduced to -50
bits.
To remove this warning you could try choosing the option of pseudo counts.

Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.901 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
